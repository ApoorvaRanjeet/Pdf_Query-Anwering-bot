I understand why so many people asked it:\\nthey love Matthew and they want him to be OK. Me too. But I always\\nbristled at that question from the press, because I couldn’t say what I wanted\\nto say: “It’s his story to tell and I’m not authorized to tell it really, am I!” I\\nwould have wanted to go on to say, “This is very intimate personal stuff and\\nif you don’t hear it from the actual person, it is, to my mind, gossip and I’m\\nnot gossiping about Matthew with you.” Knowing that no response at all\\ncould do more damage, sometimes I would just say, “I think he’s doing\\nwell.” At least that doesn’t amplify the spotlight and maybe he can have a\\nfraction of privacy as he tries to deal with this disease. But truly, I wasn’t\\nexactly sure how Matthew was doing. As he’ll tell you in this book, he was\\nkeeping it a secret. And it took some time for him to feel comfortable enough\\nto tell us some of what he was going through. Over those years I didn’t really\\ntry to intervene or confront him, because the little I knew about addiction was\\nthat his sobriety was out of my hands. And yet, I would have periods of\\nwondering if I was wrong for not doing more, doing something. But I \\ndid\\ncome to understand that this disease relentlessly fed itself and was\\ndetermined to keep going.\\nSo, I just focused on Matthew, who could make me laugh so hard every\\nday, and once a week, laugh so hard I cried and couldn’t breathe. He was\\nthere, Matthew Perry, who is whip smart … charming, sweet, sensitive, very\\nreasonable and rational. That guy, with everything he was battling, was still\\nthere. The same Matthew who, from the beginning, could lift us all up during\\na grueling night shoot for the opening titles inside that fountain. “Can’tremember a time I wasn’t in a fountain!” “What are we, wet?” “Can’t\\nremember a time I wasn’t wet … I!” (Matthew is the reason we are all\\nlaughing in that fountain in the opening titles.)\\nAfter \\nFriends\\n I didn’t see Matthew every day, and I couldn’t even hazard\\na guess with regard to his well-being.\\nThis book is the first time I’m hearing what living with and surviving his\\naddiction really was. Matthew has told me some things, but not in this kind of\\ndetail. He’s now letting us into Matthew’s head and heart in honest and very\\nexposed detail. And finally, no one needs to ask me or anyone else how\\nMatthew’s doing. He’s letting you know himself.\\nHe has survived impossible odds, but I had no idea how many times he\\nalmost didn’t make it. I’m glad you’re here, Matty. Good for you. I love you.\\n—\\nLisaPrologue\\nHi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My\\nfriends call me Matty.\\nAnd I should be dead.\\nIf you like, you can consider what you’re about to read to be a message\\nfrom the beyond, my beyond.\\nIt’s Day Seven of the Pain. And by Pain, I don’t mean a stubbed toe or\\n“The Whole Ten Yards.” I capitalize Pain because this was the worst Pain\\nI’ve ever experienced—it was the Platonic Ideal of Pain, the exemplar. I’ve\\nheard people claim that the worst pain is childbirth: well, this was the worst\\npain imaginable, but without the joy of a newborn in my arms at the end of it.\\nAnd it may have been Day Seven of Pain, but it was also Day Ten of No\\nMovement. If you catch my drift. I hadn’t taken a shit in ten days—there,\\nthere’s the drift. Something was wrong, very wrong. This was not a dull,\\nthrobbing pain, like a headache; it wasn’t even a piercing, stabbing pain, like\\nthe pancreatitis I’d had when I was thirty. This was a different kind of Pain.\\nLike my body was going to burst. Like my insides were trying to force their\\nway out. This was the no-fucking-around kind of Pain.\\nAnd the sounds. My God, the sounds. Ordinarily, I’m a pretty quiet, keep-\\nto-myself kinda fella. But on this night, I was screaming at the top of my\\nlungs. Some nights, when the wind is right and the cars are all parked up for\\nthe night, you can hear the horrific sounds of coyotes ripping apart something\\nthat is howling in the Hollywood Hills. At first it sounds like children\\nlaughing way, way off in the distance, until you realize it’s not that—it’s the\\nfoothills of death. But the worst part, of course, is when the howling stops,\\nbecause you know whatever has been attacked is now dead. This is hell.\\nAnd yes, there is a hell. Don’t let anyone tell you different. I’ve beenthere; it exists; end of discussion.\\nOn this night the animal was me. I was still screaming, fighting tooth and\\nnail for survival. Silence meant the end. Little did I know how close I was to\\nthe end.\\nAt the time, I was living in a sober living house in Southern California.\\nThis was no surprise—I have lived half my life in one form or another of\\ntreatment center or sober living house. Which is fine when you are twenty-\\nfour years old, less fine when you are forty-two years old. Now I was forty-\\nnine, still struggling to get this monkey off my back.\\nBy this point, I knew more about drug addiction and alcoholism than any\\nof the coaches and most of the doctors I encountered at these facilities.\\nUnfortunately, such self-knowledge avails you nothing. If the golden ticket to\\nsobriety involved hard work and learned information, this beast would be\\nnothing but a faint unpleasant memory. To simply stay alive, I had turned\\nmyself into a professional patient. Let’s not sugarcoat it. At forty-nine, I was\\nstill afraid to be alone. Left alone, my crazy brain (crazy only in this area by\\nthe way) would find some excuse to do the unthinkable: drink and drugs. In\\nthe face of decades of my life having been ruined by doing this, I’m terrified\\nof doing it again. I have no fear of talking in front of twenty thousand people,\\nbut put me alone on my couch in front of a TV for the night and I get scared.\\nAnd that \\nfear is of my own mind; fear of my own thoughts; fear that my mind\\nwill urge me to turn to drugs, as it has so many times before. My mind is out\\nto kill me, and I know it. I am constantly filled with a lurking loneliness, a\\nyearning, clinging to the notion that something outside of me will fix me. But\\nI had had all that the outside had to offer!\\nJulia Roberts is my girlfriend. \\nIt doesn’t matter, you have to drink.\\nI just bought my dream house—it looks out across the whole city! \\nCan’t\\nenjoy that without a drug dealer.\\nI’m making a million dollars a week—I win right? \\nWould you like to\\ndrink? Why yes, I would. Thank you very much.\\nI’d had it all. But it was all a trick. Nothing was going to fix this. It would\\nbe years before I even grasped the notion of a solution. Please don’t\\nmisunderstand me. All of those things—Julia and the dream house and $1\\nmillion a week—were wonderful, and I will be eternally grateful for all ofthem. I am one of the luckiest men on the planet. And boy did I have fun.\\nThey just weren’t the answer. If I had to do it all over again, would I still\\naudition for \\nFriends\\n? You bet your ass I would. Would I drink again? You\\nbet your ass I would. If I didn’t have alcohol to soothe my nerves and help\\nme have fun, I would have leaped off a tall building sometime in my\\ntwenties. My grandfather, the wonderful Alton L. Perry, grew up around an\\nalcoholic father, and as a result, he never touched a drink in his life, all\\nninety-six long, wonderful years of it.\\nI am not my grandfather.\\nI don’t write all this so anyone will feel sorry for me—I write these words\\nbecause they are true. I write them because someone else may be confused by\\nthe fact that they know they should stop drinking—like me, they have all the\\ninformation, and they understand the consequences—but they still can’t stop\\ndrinking. You are not alone, my brothers and sisters. (In the dictionary under\\nthe word “addict,” there should be a picture of me looking around, very\\nconfused.)\\nIn the sober living house in Southern California, I had a view of West LA\\nand two queen-size beds. The other bed was occupied by my assistant/best\\nfriend, Erin, a lesbian whose friendship I treasure because it brings me the joy\\nof female companionship without the romantic tension that has seemed to\\nruin my friendships with straight women (not to mention, we can talk about\\nhot women together). I’d met her two years earlier, at another rehab where\\nshe had been working at the time. I didn’t get sober back then, but I saw how\\nwonderful she was in every way and promptly stole her from that sober living\\nrehab and made her my assistant, and she became my best friend. She, too,\\nunderstood the nature of addiction and would come to know my struggles\\nbetter than any doctor I’d ever seen.\\nDespite the comfort that Erin brought to the situation, I still spent many\\nsleepless nights in Southern California. Sleep is a real issue for me, especially\\nwhen I’m in one of these places. That said, I don’t think I have ever slept for\\nmore than four hours straight in my entire life. It didn’t help that we’d been\\nwatching nothing but prison documentaries—and I was coming off so much\\nXanax my brain had fried to the point where I was convinced that I was an\\nactual prisoner and that this sober living place was an actual jail. I have ashrink whose mantra is “reality is an acquired taste”—well, I’d lost both my\\ntaste and smell of reality by that point; I had Covid of the understanding; I\\nwas completely delusional.\\nThere was nothing delusional about the Pain, though; in fact, it hurt so\\nmuch I’d stopped smoking, which if you knew how much I smoked, you’d\\nthink was a pretty sure sign that something very serious was wrong. One\\nemployee of the place, whose name badge might as well have read \\nNURSE\\nFUCKFACE\\n, suggested taking an Epsom salts bath to alleviate the “discomfort.”\\nYou wouldn’t take a Band-Aid to a road traffic accident; you don’t put\\nsomeone in this much Pain in water \\nfilled with his own sauce. But reality is\\nan acquired taste, remember, so I actually took the actual Epsom salts bath.\\nThere I sat, naked, in Pain, howling like a dog being ripped to shreds by\\ncoyotes. Erin heard me—hell, people in San Diego heard me. She appeared at\\nthe bathroom door, and looking down upon my sad, naked form as I writhed\\nin Pain, she said very simply, “Do you want to go to the hospital?”\\nIf Erin thought it was hospital-bad, it was hospital-bad. Plus, she’d\\nalready noticed I wasn’t smoking.\\n“That sounds like a pretty damn good idea to me,” I said in between\\nhowls.\\nSomehow, Erin helped me out of the bath and dried me off. I started to\\nput my clothes back on just as a counselor—alerted by the slaughter of a dog\\non the premises, presumably—appeared at the door.\\n“I’m taking him to the hospital,” Erin said.\\nCatherine, the counselor, just so happened to be a beautiful blond woman\\nto whom I had apparently proposed upon my arrival, so she probably wasn’t\\nmy biggest fan. (Not kidding, I had been so out of it when we’d arrived that\\nI’d asked her to marry me, and then promptly fell down a flight of stairs.)\\n“This is just drug-seeking behavior,” Catherine said to Erin as I continued\\nto dress. “He’s going to ask for drugs at the hospital.”\\nWell, this marriage is off,\\n I thought.\\nBy now, the howls had alerted others that there were probably canine\\nentrails all over the bathroom floor, or someone was in real Pain. The head\\ncounselor, Charles—think: male model father, homeless mother—joined\\nCatherine in the doorway, to help her block our expected exit.Block our exit? What were we, twelve years old?\\n“He’s our patient,” Catherine said. “You don’t have the right to take\\nhim.”\\n“I know Matty,” Erin insisted. “He isn’t trying to get drugs.”\\nThen Erin turned to me.\\n“Do you need to go to the hospital, Matty?” I nodded and screamed some\\nmore.\\n“I’m taking him,” Erin said.\\nSomehow, we pushed past Catherine and Charles, out of the building, and\\ninto the parking lot. I say “somehow” not because Catherine and Charles\\nmade much of a fuss about stopping us, but because every time my feet\\ntouched the ground, the Pain became even more excruciating.\\nUp there in the sky, looking down on me with scorn, caring not for my\\nagony, was a bright yellow ball.\\nWhat’s that?\\n I thought through paroxysms of agony. \\nOh, the sun. Right …\\nI didn’t get out much.\\n“We have a high-profile coming in with severe abdominal pain,” Erin\\nsaid into her phone as she unlocked the car. Cars are stupid, ordinary things\\nuntil you’re not allowed to drive them, at which point they become magical\\nboxes of freedom and signs of a successful previous life. Erin lifted me into\\nthe passenger seat, and I lay back. My belly was twisting in agony.\\nErin got into the driver’s seat, turned to me, and said, “Do you want to get\\nthere fast, or do you want me to avoid the LA potholes?”\\n“Just get there, woman!” I managed to say.\\nBy now Charles and Catherine had decided to up their efforts to thwart us\\nand now stood in front of the car, blocking us. Charles’s hands were lifted,\\nhis palms facing us, as if to say “No!”, as though three thousand pounds of\\nmotor vehicle could be stopped with the force of his mitts.\\nTo make matters worse, Erin couldn’t start the car. The ignition works via\\ntelling\\n the car to start out loud, because you know, I was on \\nFriends\\n.\\nCatherine and the Palms didn’t budge. Once she worked out \\nhow to start the\\ndamn thing, there was only one thing more to do: Erin revved the engine, put\\nthe car in drive, and slewed it up and onto a curb—the jolt of that action\\nalone, ricocheting through my entire body, almost caused me to die rightthere. With two wheels up on the curb, she revved past Catherine and\\nCharles, and out into the street. They just watched us drive away, though by\\nthis point I would have urged her to drive over them—not being able to stop\\nscreaming is a very scary state to be in.\\nIf I were just doing this to get drugs, then I deserved an Oscar.\\n“Are you aiming for the speed bumps? I don’t know if you’ve noticed,\\nbut I’m kind of struggling right now. Slow down,” I begged her. We both had\\ntears streaming down our faces.\\n“I have to go fast,” Erin said, her brown, compassionate eyes looking\\nover at me with concern and fear. “We have to get you there now.”\\nIt was right about here that I drifted out of consciousness. (A 10 on the\\npain scale is losing consciousness by the way.)\\n[Please note: for the next few paragraphs, this book will be a biography\\nrather than a memoir because I was no longer there.]\\nThe closest hospital to the sober house was Saint John’s. Since Erin had\\nhad the foresight to call ahead and alert them that a VIP was en route,\\nsomeone met us at the emergency valet. Not knowing at the time how crazy\\nsick I was when she made the call, Erin had been concerned about my\\nprivacy. But the folks at the hospital could see something was seriously\\nwrong and rushed me to a treatment room. There, I was heard to say, “Erin,\\nwhy are there Ping-Pong balls on the couch?”\\nThere was no couch, and there were no Ping-Pong balls—I was just\\ncompletely delusional. (I wasn’t aware that pain could make you delusional,\\nbut there ya go.) Then the Dilaudid (my personal favorite drug in the whole\\nwide world) hit my brain, and I briefly regained consciousness.\\nI was told I needed surgery immediately, and suddenly, every nurse in\\nCalifornia descended upon my room. One of them turned to Erin and said,\\n“Get ready to run!” Erin was ready, and we all ran—well, \\nthey\\n ran, I was\\nmerely wheeled at high speed to a procedure room. Erin was asked to leave\\nmere seconds after I’d said to her “Please don’t leave,” then I closed my eyes,\\nand they wouldn’t open again for two weeks.\\nYes, that’s right: a coma, ladies and gentlemen! (And those\\nmotherfuckers back at the sober living had tried to block the car?)\\nThe first thing that happened when I lapsed into a coma was that Iaspirated into my breathing tube, vomiting ten days’ worth of toxic shit\\ndirectly into my lungs. My lungs didn’t like that very much—enter instant\\npneumonia—and that is when my colon exploded. Let me repeat for those in\\nthe back: my colon exploded! I’ve been accused of being full of shit before,\\nbut this time I really was.\\nI’m glad I wasn’t there for that.\\nIt was almost certain at that point that I was going to die. Was I unlucky\\nthat my colon exploded? Or was I lucky that it happened in the one room in\\nSouthern California where they could do something about it? Either way, I\\nnow faced a seven-hour surgery, which at least gave all my loved ones ample\\ntime to race to the hospital. As they arrived they were each told, “Matthew\\nhas a two percent chance of making it through the night.”\\nEveryone was so wrought with emotion that some crumbled to the ground\\nright there in the hospital lobby. I will have to live out the rest of my days\\nknowing that my mother and others heard those words.\\nWith me in surgery for at least seven hours and convinced that the\\nhospital would do everything they could, my family and friends went home\\nfor the night for some rest while my subconscious fought for my life amid the\\nknives and tubes and blood.\\nSpoiler alert: I \\ndid\\n make it through the night. But I wasn’t out of the\\nwoods yet. My family and friends were told that the only thing that could\\nkeep me alive short-term was an ECMO machine (ECMO stands for\\nExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation). The ECMO move is often called a\\nHail Mary—for a start, four patients that week at UCLA had been put on\\nECMO, and they all died.\\nMaking things even tougher, Saint John’s didn’t have an ECMO machine.\\nCedars-Sinai was called—they took one look at my chart and apparently said,\\n“Matthew Perry is not dying in our hospital.”\\nThanks, guys.\\nUCLA wasn’t willing to take me, either—for the same reason? Who can\\nsay?—but at least they were willing to send an ECMO machine and a team. I\\nwas hooked up to it for several hours, and it seemed to work! I was then\\ntransferred to UCLA itself, in an ambulance filled with doctors and nurses.\\n(There was no way I’d survive a fifteen-minute car ride, especially the wayErin drives.)\\nAt UCLA I was taken to the heart and lung ICU unit; it would become\\nmy home for the next six weeks. I was still in a coma, but honestly, I\\nprobably loved it. I was lying down, all snuggled up, and they were pumping\\ndrugs into me—what’s better than that?\\nI’m told that during my coma I was never left alone, not once—there was\\nalways a member of my family or a friend in the room with me. They held\\ncandlelight vigils; did prayer circles. Love was all around me.\\nEventually, my eyes magically opened.\\n[Back to the memoir.]\\nThe first thing I saw was my mother.\\n“What’s going on?” I managed to croak. “Where the hell am I?”\\nThe last thing I remembered was being in a car with Erin.\\n“Your colon exploded,” Mom said.\\nWith that information, I did what any comic actor might do: I rolled my\\neyes and went back to sleep.\\nI have been told that when someone is \\nreally\\n sick a kind of disconnect\\nhappens—a “God only gives you what you can handle” kind of thing kicks\\nin. As for me, well, in the weeks after I came out of my coma, I refused to let\\nanyone tell me exactly what had happened. I was too afraid that it was my\\nfault; that I had done this to myself. So instead of talking about it, I did the\\none thing I felt I \\ncould\\n do—during the days in the hospital I threw myself into\\nfamily, spending hours with my beautiful sisters, Emily, Maria, and\\nMadeline, who were funny and caring and \\nthere\\n. At night it was Erin; I was\\nnever alone once again.\\nEventually, one day Maria—the hub of the Perry family (my mom is the\\nhub of the Morrison side)—decided it was time for me to be told what had\\nhappened. There I was, attached to fifty wires like a robot, bedridden, as\\nMaria filled me in. My very fears had been true: I had done this; this was my\\nfault.\\nI cried—oh \\nboy\\n did I cry. Maria did her best to be wonderfully consoling,\\nbut there was no consoling this. I had all but killed myself. I had never been apartier—taking all of those drugs (and it was a \\nlot\\n of drugs) was just a futile\\nattempt to feel better. Trust me to take trying to feel better to death’s door.\\nAnd yet here I was, still alive. \\nWhy\\n? Why had I been spared?\\nThings got worse before they got better, though.\\nEvery morning, it seemed, some doctor would come into my room and\\ngive me more bad news. If something could go wrong, it did. I already had a\\ncolostomy bag—at least I’d been told it was reversible, thank God—but now,\\napparently, there was a fistula, a hole in one of my intestines. Problem was,\\nthey couldn’t find it. To help, I was given \\nanother\\n bag that oozed out gross\\ngreen stuff, but that new bag meant \\nthat I was not allowed to eat or drink\\nanything until they found it. They searched daily for that fistula while I got\\nthirstier and thirstier. I was literally begging for a Diet Coke and having\\ndreams of being chased by a gigantic can of Diet Sprite. After a full month—\\na month!—they finally found the fistula in some tube behind my colon. I\\nthought, \\nHey fellas, if you are looking for a hole in my intestine, why not start\\nlooking behind the thing that FUCKING EXPLODED.\\n Now that they’d found\\nthe hole, they could start to fix it, and I could learn to walk again.\\nI knew I was on my way back when I realized that I was attracted to the\\ntherapist they assigned to me. True, I had a giant scar on my stomach, but I\\nwas never a guy who took his shirt off much anyway. I’m no Matthew\\nMcConaughey, and when I take a shower, I just make sure to keep my eyes\\nclosed.\\nAs I’ve said, for the entire stay in those hospitals, I was never left alone—not\\nonce. So, there \\nis\\n light in the darkness. It’s there—you just have to look hard\\nenough for it.\\nAfter five very long months, I was released. I was told that within the\\nyear, everything inside me would heal enough so that I could have a second\\nsurgery to reverse the colostomy bag. But for now, we packed my overnight\\nbags—five months of overnights—and we made the voyage home.\\nAlso, I’m Batman.1\\nThe View\\nNobody ever thinks that something really bad is going to happen to them.\\nUntil it does. And nobody comes back from a perforated bowel, aspiration\\npneumonia, and an ECMO machine. Until somebody did.\\nMe.\\nI’m writing this in a rented house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. (My real\\nhouse is down the street being renovated—they say it will take six months, so\\nI figure about a year.) A pair of red-tailed hawks is circling below me in the\\ncanyon that brings the Palisades down to the water. It’s a gorgeous spring day\\nin Los Angeles. This morning I’ve been busy hanging art on my walls (or\\nrather, having them hung—I’m not so handy). I’ve really gotten into art in the\\nlast few years, and if you look close enough, you’ll find the odd Banksy or\\ntwo. I’m also working on the second draft of a screenplay. There’s fresh Diet\\nCoke in my glass, and a full pack of Marlboros in my pocket. Sometimes,\\nthese things are enough.\\nSometimes.\\nI keep coming back to this singular, inescapable fact: I am \\nalive.\\n Given\\nthe odds, those three words are more miraculous than you might imagine; to\\nme, they have an odd, shiny quality, like rocks brought back from a distant\\nplanet. No one can quite believe it. It is very odd \\nto live in a world where if\\nyou died, it would shock people but surprise no one.\\nWhat those three words—\\nI am alive\\n—fill me with, above all else, is a\\nsense of profound gratitude. When you’ve been as close to the celestial as I\\nhave, you don’t really have a choice about gratitude: it sits on your living\\nroom table like a coffee-table book—you barely notice it, but it’s there. Yetstalking that gratitude, buried deep somewhere in the faint-anise-distant-\\nlicorice of the Diet Coke, and filling my lungs like every drag of every\\ncigarette, there’s a nagging agony.\\nI can’t help but ask myself the overwhelming question: Why? Why am I\\nalive? I have a hint to the answer, but it is not fully formed yet. It’s in the\\nvicinity of helping people, I know that, but I don’t know how. The best thing\\nabout me, bar none, is that if a fellow alcoholic comes up to me and asks me\\nif I can help them stop drinking, I can say yes, and actually follow up and do\\nit. I can help a desperate man get sober. The answer to “Why am I alive?” I\\nbelieve lives somewhere in there. After all, it’s the only thing I’ve found that\\ntruly feels good. It is undeniable that there is God there.\\nBut, you see, I can’t say yes to that question “Why?” when I feel like I’m\\nnot enough. You can’t give away something you do not have. And most of\\nthe time I have these nagging thoughts: \\nI’m not enough, I don’t matter, I am\\ntoo needy.\\n These thoughts make me uncomfortable. I need love, but I don’t\\ntrust it. If I drop my game, my Chandler, and show you who I really am, you\\nmight notice me, but worse, you might notice me and leave me. And I can’t\\nhave that. I won’t survive that. Not anymore. It will turn me into a speck of\\ndust and annihilate me.\\nSo, I will leave you first. I will fabricate in my mind that something went\\nwrong with \\nyou,\\n and I’ll believe it. And I’ll leave. \\nBut something can’t go\\nwrong with all of them, Matso.\\n What’s the common denominator here?\\nAnd now these scars on my stomach. These broken love affairs. \\nLeaving\\nRachel. (No not that one. The real Rachel. The ex-girlfriend of my dreams,\\nRachel.) They haunt me as I lie awake at 4:00 \\nA.M.,\\n in my house with a view\\nin the Pacific Palisades. I’m fifty-two. It’s not that cute anymore.\\nEvery house I have ever lived in has had a view. That’s the most important\\nthing to me.\\nWhen I was five years old, I was sent on a plane from Montreal, Canada,\\nwhere I lived with my mom, to Los Angeles, California, where I would visit\\nmy dad. I was what is called “an unaccompanied minor” (at one point that\\nwas the title of this book). It was typical to send kids on planes back then—flying children alone at that age was just something people did. It wasn’t\\nright, but they did it. For maybe a millisecond I thought it would be an\\nexciting adventure, and then I realized I was too young to be alone and this\\nwas all completely terrifying (and bullshit). One of you guys come pick me\\nup! I was five. Is everybody crazy?\\nThe hundreds of thousands of dollars that particular choice cost me in\\ntherapy? May I get that back, please?\\nYou do get all sorts of perks when you’re an unaccompanied minor on a\\nplane, including a little sign around your neck that reads \\nUNACCOMPANIED\\nMINOR\\n, plus early boarding, kids-only lounges, snacks up the ying-yang,\\nsomeone to escort you to the plane … maybe it \\nshould\\n have been amazing\\n(later, as a famous person, I got all these perks and more at airports, but every\\ntime it reminded me of that first flight, so I hated them). The flight attendants\\nwere supposed to look after me, but they were busy serving champagne in\\ncoach (that’s what they did in the anything-goes 1970s). The two-drink\\nmaximum had recently been done away with, so that flight felt like six hours\\nin Sodom and Gomorrah. The stench of alcohol was everywhere; the guy\\nnext to me must have had ten old-fashioneds. (I stopped counting after a\\ncouple of \\nhours.) I couldn’t imagine why any adult would want to drink the\\nsame drink over and over again … Ah, innocence.\\nI pushed the little service button when I dared, which wasn’t very often.\\nThe flight attendants—in their 1970s hot boots and short-shorts—would\\ncome by, ruffle my hair, move on.\\nI was fucking terrified. I tried to read my \\nHighlights\\n magazine, but every\\ntime the plane hit a bump in the air, I knew I was about to die. I had no one to\\ntell me it was OK, no one to look at for reassurance. My feet didn’t even\\nreach the floor. I was too scared to recline the seat and take a nap, so I just\\nstayed awake, waiting for the next bump, wondering over and over what it\\nwould be like to fall thirty-five thousand feet.\\nI didn’t fall, at least not literally. Eventually, the plane began its descent\\ninto the beautiful California evening. I could see the lights twinkling, streets\\nsplayed out like a great sparkling magic carpet, wide swathes of dark I now\\nknow were the hills, the city pulsing up toward me as I plastered my little\\nface against the plane window, and I so vividly remember thinking that thoselights, and all that beauty, meant I was about to have a parent.\\nNot having a parent on that flight is one of the many things that led to a\\nlifelong feeling of abandonment.… If I’d been enough, they wouldn’t have\\nleft me unaccompanied, right? Isn’t that how all this was supposed to work?\\nThe other kids had parents with them. I had a sign and a magazine.\\nSo that’s why when I buy a new house—and there have been many (never\\nunderestimate a geographic)—it has to have a view. I want the sense that I\\ncan look down on safety, on someplace where someone is thinking of me, at\\na place where love is. Down there, somewhere in that valley, or in that vast\\nocean out there beyond the Pacific Coast Highway, on the gleaming\\nprimaries of the red-tail’s wings, that’s where parenting is. That’s where love\\nis. That’s where home is. I can feel safe now.\\nWhy was that little kid on a plane on his own? Maybe fly to Canada\\n \\nand\\nfucking pick him up?\\n That’s a question I often wonder about but would never\\ndare to ask.\\nI’m not the biggest fan of confrontation. I ask a lot of questions. Just not\\nout loud.\\nFor a long time, I tried to find just about anything and anybody to blame for\\nthe mess I kept finding myself in.\\nI’ve spent a lot of my life in hospitals. Being in hospitals makes even the\\nbest of us self-pitying, and I’ve made a solid effort at self-pity. Each time I lie\\nthere, I find myself thinking back through the life I’ve lived, turning each\\nmoment of it this way and that, like a confusing find in an archaeological dig,\\ntrying to find some reason why I had spent so much of my life in discomfort\\nand emotional pain. I always understood where the real pain was coming\\nfrom. (I always knew why I was in \\nphysical\\n pain at that moment—the answer\\nwas, \\nwell, you can’t drink that much, asshole\\n.)\\nFor a start, I wanted to blame my loving, well-intentioned parents …\\nloving, well-intentioned, and mesmerizingly attractive, to boot.\\nLet’s go back to Friday, January 28, 1966—the scene is Waterloo\\nLutheran University in Ontario.\\nWe’re at the fifth annual Miss Canadian University Snow Queencompetition (“judged on the basis of intelligence, participation in student\\nactivities, and personality as well as beauty”). Those Canadians spared no\\nexpense to herald a new Miss CUSQ; there was to be a “torchlight parade\\nwith floats, bands, and the contestants,” plus “an outdoor cookout and a\\nhockey game.”\\nThe list of candidates for the honor includes one Suzanne Langford—she\\nis listed eleventh and is representing the University of Toronto. Against her\\nhave been arrayed beauties with wonderful names like Ruth \\nShaver from\\nBritish Columbia; Martha Quail from Ottawa; and even Helen “Chickie”\\nFuhrer from McGill, who had presumably added the “Chickie” to mitigate\\nthe fact that her surname was a tad unfortunate just two decades after the end\\nof World War II.\\nBut these young women were no match for the beautiful Miss Langford.\\nThat freezing January evening the previous year’s winner helped crown the\\nfifth Miss Canadian University Snow Queen, and with that honor came a sash\\nand responsibility: it would now be Miss Langford’s job to hand over the\\ncrown the following year.\\nThe 1967 pageant was similarly exciting. This year there was to be a\\nconcert given by the Serendipity Singers, a Mamas & the Papas–kind of\\ncombo that just so happened to have a lead singer called John Bennett Perry.\\nThe Serendipity Singers were an anomaly even in the folk-heavy 1960s—\\ntheir biggest (and only) hit, “Don’t Let the Rain Come Down,” was a rehash\\nof a British nursery rhyme—even so, it reached number 2 on the adult\\ncontemporary list and number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1964. But\\nthat achievement is somewhat put in perspective because the Beatles\\nfamously had the \\nentire top five\\n—“Can’t Buy Me Love,” “Twist and Shout,”\\n“She Loves You,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” and “Please, Please Me.” No\\nmatter to John Perry—he was on the road, a working musician, getting to\\nsing for his supper, and what could be better than having a gig at the Miss\\nCanadian University Snow Queen gala in Ontario? There he was, happily\\nsinging, “Now this crooked little man and his crooked cat and mouse They all\\nlive together in a crooked little house,” and flirting across the microphone\\nwith last year’s Miss Canadian University Snow Queen, Suzanne Langford.\\nAt the time, they were two of the most gorgeous people on the face of theplanet—you should see pictures of them from their wedding—you just want\\nto punch them in their perfectly chiseled faces. They didn’t stand a chance.\\nWhen two people look that good, they just kind of morph into each other.\\nThe flirting turned to dancing once John had finished his gig, and that\\nmight have been it, but for the massive, kismetic snowstorm that stalked the\\nevening and made it impossible for the Serendipity Singers to get out of\\ntown. So, that’s the meet-cute: a folk singer and a beauty queen fall in love in\\na snowbound Canadian town in 1967 … best-looking man on the planet\\nmeets best-looking woman on the planet. Everyone there might as well have\\ngone home.\\nJohn Perry stayed the night, and Suzanne Langford was quite happy about\\nthat, and about a year or two later, after the montage scene, she found herself\\nin Williamstown, Massachusetts, where John is from, and cells inside her\\nwere dividing and conquering. Maybe something in those simple divisions\\nwent awry, who can say—all I know is, addiction is an illness, and like my\\nparents when they met, I didn’t stand a fucking chance.\\nI was born on August 19, 1969, a Tuesday, the son of John Bennett Perry,\\nlate of the Serendipity Singers, and Suzanne Marie Langford, former Miss\\nCanadian University Snow Queen. There was a huge storm the night I arrived\\n(of course there was); everyone was playing Monopoly waiting for me to\\nshow up (of course they were). I hit the planet about a month after the Moon\\nlanding, and one day after Woodstock ended—so, somewhere between the\\ncosmic perfection of the heavenly orbs, and all that shit down at Yasgur’s\\nFarm, I became life, interrupting someone’s chance to build hotels on\\nBoardwalk.\\nI came out screaming, and I didn’t stop screaming. For weeks. I was a\\ncolicky kid—my stomach was a problem from the very start. My parents\\nwere being driven crazy by the amount I was crying. Crazy? Concerned, so\\nthey hauled me off to a doctor. This is 1969, a prehistoric time compared to\\nnow. That said, I don’t know how advanced civilization has to be to\\nunderstand that giving \\nphenobarbital\\n to a baby \\nwho just entered his second\\nmonth of breathing God’s air is, at best, an \\ninteresting\\n approach to pediatric\\nmedicine. But it wasn’t that rare in the 1960s to slip the parents of a colicky\\nchild a major barbiturate. Some older doctors swore by it—and by it, I mean,“prescribing a major barbiturate for a child that’s barely born who won’t stop\\ncrying.”\\nI want to be very clear on this point. I do NOT blame my parents for this.\\nYour child is crying all the time, clearly something is wrong, the doctor\\nprescribes a drug, he’s not the only doctor who thinks it’s a good idea, you\\ngive the drug to the child, the child stops crying. It was a different time.\\nThere I was, on the knee of my stressed mother, screaming over her\\ntwenty-one-year-old shoulder as some dinosaur in a white coat, barely\\nlooking up from his wide oak desk, tutted under his bad breath at “parents\\nthese days,” and wrote a script for a major addictive barbiturate.\\nI was noisy and needy, and it was answered with a pill. (Hmm, that\\nsounds like my fucking twenties.)\\nI’m told I took phenobarbital during the second month of my life,\\nbetween the ages of thirty and sixty days. This is an important time in a\\nbaby’s development, especially when it comes to sleeping. (Fifty years later I\\nstill don’t sleep well.) Once the barbiturate was on board, I would just conk\\nout. Apparently, I’d be crying, and the drug would hit, and I’d be knocked\\nout, and this would cause my father to erupt in laughter. He wasn’t being\\ncruel; stoned babies are funny. There are baby pictures of me where you can\\ntell I’m just completely fucking zonked, nodding like an addict at the age of\\nseven weeks. Which is oddly appropriate for a kid born the day after\\nWoodstock ended, I guess.\\nI was being needy; I was not the cute smiling baby everyone was hoping\\nfor. \\nI’ll just take this and shut the fuck up.\\nIronically, barbiturates and I have had a very strange relationship over the\\nyears. People would be surprised to know that I have mostly been sober since\\n2001. Save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps over \\nthe years. When\\nthese mishaps occur, if you want to be sober, which I always did, you’d be\\ngiven drugs to help you along. What drug may you ask? You guessed it:\\nphenobarbital!\\n Barbiturates calm you down as you try to get whatever other\\nshit is in your body out; and hey, I started taking one at thirty days old, so as\\nan adult I just picked up where I’d left off. When I’m at a detox, I’m very\\nneedy and uncomfortable—I’m sorry to say I’m the worst patient in the\\nworld.Detox is hell. Detox is lying in bed, watching the seconds go by, knowing\\nyou are nowhere near feeling OK. When I’m detoxing, I feel like I’m dying. I\\nfeel like it will never end. My insides feel like they’re trying to crawl out of\\nmy body. I’m shaking and sweating. I’m like that baby who wasn’t given a\\npill to make things better. I have chosen to be high for four hours, knowing I\\nwill then be in that hell for seven days. (I told you this part of me is crazy,\\nright?) Sometimes, I have to be locked away for months at a time to break the\\ncycle.\\nWhen I’m detoxing, “OK” is a distant memory, or something reserved for\\nHallmark cards. I’m begging like a child for any kind of medication that will\\nhelp ease the symptoms—a grown man, who’s probably looking great on the\\ncover of \\nPeople\\n magazine at the very same time, \\nbegging\\n for relief. I would\\ngive up everything—every car, every house, all the money—just to make it\\nstop. And when detox is finally over, you are bathed in relief, swearing up\\nand down that you will never put yourself through that again. Until there you\\nare, three weeks later, in the exact same position.\\nIt’s crazy. I am crazy.\\nAnd like a baby, I didn’t want to do the inner work for so long, because if\\na pill fixes it, well, that’s easier, and that’s what I was taught.\\nAt around my ninth month, my parents decided they had had enough of each\\nother, stashed me in a car seat in Williamstown, and the three \\nof us drove to\\nthe Canadian border—five and a half hours. I can just imagine the silence of\\nthat car ride. I didn’t speak, of course, and the two former lovebirds in the\\nfront seat had had enough of speaking to each other. And yet that silence\\nmust have been deafening. Some major shit was going down. There, with the\\ndistant thrum of the Niagara Falls as a background, my maternal grandfather,\\nthe military-like Warren Langford, was waiting for us, pacing up and down,\\nstamping his feet to keep warm, or in frustration, or both. He would have\\nbeen waving at us as we pulled up, as though we were about to embark upon\\nsome kind of fun holiday. I would have been excited to see him, and then,\\nI’m told, my father took me out of my car seat, handed me into my\\ngrandfather’s arms, and, with that, he quietly abandoned me and my mother.Then, Mom finally got out of our car, too, and me, my mom, and my\\ngrandfather stood listening to the waters hurtle over the Falls and roar into the\\nNiagara Gorge and watched as my father sped away, forever.\\nSeems we weren’t going to live together in \\na crooked little house\\n after all.\\nI imagine back then I was told that my dad would be back soon.\\n“Don’t worry,” my mother probably said, “he’s just going to work,\\nMatso. He’ll be back.”\\n“Come on, little chum,” Grampa would have said, “let’s go find Nanny.\\nShe’s made your favorite pasghetti for dinner.”\\nEvery parent goes off to work, and they always come back. That’s just the\\nnormal way of things. Nothing to worry about. Nothing that would bring on a\\ncolic attack, or addiction, or a lifetime of feeling abandoned, or that I am not\\nenough, or a continual lack of comfort, or a desperate need for love, or that I\\ndidn’t matter.\\nMy father sped away, to God knows where. He didn’t come back from\\nwork that first day, nor the second. I was hoping he’d be home after three\\ndays, then maybe a week, then maybe a month, but after about six weeks I\\nstopped hoping. I was too young to understand where \\nCalifornia was, or what\\nit meant to “go follow his dream of being an actor”—what the fuck is an\\nactor? And where the fuck is my dad?\\nMy dad, who later in life became a wonderful father, was leaving his\\nbaby alone with a twenty-one-year-old woman who he knew was way too\\nyoung to parent a child on her own. My mother is wonderful, and emotional,\\nand she was just too young. She, like me, had been abandoned, too, right\\nthere in the parking lot of the border crossing between the United States and\\nCanada. My mother had gotten pregnant with me when she was twenty years\\nold, and by the time she was twenty-one, and a new mother, she was single. If\\nI’d\\n had a baby at twenty-one, I would have tried to drink it. She did her best,\\nand that says a lot about her, but still, she simply wasn’t ready for the\\nresponsibility, and I wasn’t ready to deal with anything, being just born n’all.\\nMom and I were both abandoned, in fact, before we’d even gotten to\\nknow each other.With Dad gone, I quickly understood that I had a role to play at home. My\\njob was to entertain, to cajole, to delight, to make others laugh, to soothe, to\\nplease, to be the Fool to the entire court.\\nEven when I lost an entire part of my body. Actually, especially then.\\nThe phenobarbital behind me—its use faded like my memories of my\\nfather’s face—I plowed on full pelt into a toddlerdom, in which I learned\\nhow to be the caretaker.\\nWhen I was in kindergarten, some dim kid slammed a door on my hand,\\nand after the great sparkles of blood stopped arcing up like fireworks,\\nsomeone thought to bandage me up and take me to a hospital. There, it was\\nclear that I had, in fact, lost the tip of my middle finger. My mother was\\ncalled and sped to the hospital. She came in sobbing (understandably) and\\nfound me standing on a gurney with a \\ngigantic bandage on my hand. Before\\nshe could say anything, I said, “You don’t need to cry—I didn’t cry.”\\nThere I was already: the performer, the people pleaser. (Who knows—\\nmaybe I even did a little Chandler Bing startle/double take just to land the\\nline?) Even at three years old I’d learned I’d have to be the man of the house.\\nI had to take care of my mother, even though my finger had just been sliced\\noff. I guess I’d learned at thirty days old that if I cried, I’d get knocked out,\\nso I’d better not cry; or I knew I had to make sure everyone, including my\\nmother, felt safe and OK. Or, it was just a fucking great line for a toddler to\\nsay standing on a gurney like a boss.\\nNot that much has changed. If you give me all the OxyContin I can stand,\\nI feel taken care of, and when I’m taken care of, I can take care of everybody\\nelse and look outward and be in service to someone. But \\nwithout\\n medication,\\nI feel that I would just sputter away into a sea of nothingness. This, of course,\\nmeans it’s pretty much impossible for me to be useful or in service in a\\nrelationship because I’m just trying to get to the next minute, next hour, next\\nday. There’s that dis-ease of fear, the licorice of inadequacy. A touch of this\\ndrug, a drop of that, and I’m OK—you don’t taste anything when you’re\\njacked on something.\\n(Back in the days before 9/11, kids—and curious adults—on planes\\nwould sometimes be allowed up to the cockpit to have a look around. When I\\nwas about nine, I was brought up to a cockpit and was so mesmerized by thebuttons and the captain and all the information that I forgot to put my hand in\\nmy pocket for the first time in six years. I had never showed it; I was so\\nashamed. But the pilot noticed and said, “Let me see your hand.”\\nEmbarrassed, I showed him. Then he said, “Here, take a look.” Turns out he\\nwas missing the exact same bit of his middle finger on his right hand.\\nHere was this man, captaining the whole plane and knowing what \\nall of\\nthose buttons did and understanding all the captivating information in a\\ncockpit, and he was missing part of his finger, too. From that day forth—I’m\\nfifty-two now—I have never hidden my hand. In fact, because I smoked for\\nso many years a lot of people noticed it and people would ask what happened.\\nAt least I got an OK gag out of the incident with the door—for years I’d\\ncomplain that since losing half a finger I could tell people only to “Fuck y\\n—”)\\nI may not have had a father, or all ten fingers, but what I did have was a fast\\nmind and a fast mouth, even then. Combine that with a mother who was very\\nbusy, and important, and who also had a fast mind and mouth … well, there\\nwere times I was happy to lecture my mother about her lack of attention, and\\nlet’s just say it didn’t go that well. It’s important to note here that I could\\nnever get enough attention—no matter what she did, it was never enough.\\nAnd let’s not forget that she was doing the work of two people, while dear\\nold dad was busy wrestling with his own demons and desires in LA.\\nSuzanne Perry (she kept Dad’s name professionally) was basically\\nAllison Janney from \\nThe West Wing\\n—a spinmeister. She was the press\\nsecretary for Pierre Trudeau, who was then the Canadian prime minister and\\na general gallivanter. (The \\nToronto Star\\n captioned a picture of the two of\\nthem this way: “Press aide Suzanne Perry works for one of Canada’s best-\\nknown men—Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau—but she is quickly becoming a\\ncelebrity herself; simply by appearing at his side.”) Imagine that: you’re a\\ncelebrity merely by standing next to Pierre Trudeau. He was the suave,\\nsocially connected PM who had once dated Barbra Streisand, Kim Cattrall,\\nMargot Kidder … his ambassador to DC once grouched that he’d invited not\\none but \\nthree\\n separate girlfriends to a dinner, so there was a lot of spinningneeded for a man \\nso enamored of women. My mom’s job therefore meant\\nthat she was away at work a lot—and I was left to compete with the ongoing\\nconcerns of a major Western democracy and its charismatic, swordsman\\nleader if I wanted a little attention. (I believe the phrase at the time was\\n“latchkey kid”—a bland term for being left fucking alone.) Accordingly, I\\nlearned to be funny (pratfalls, quick one-liners, you know the drill) because I\\nhad\\n to be—my mother was stressed by her stressful job, and already highly\\nemotional (and abandoned), and me being funny tended to calm her down\\nenough that she would cook some food, sit down at the dinner table with me,\\nand hear me out, after I heard \\nher\\n out, of course. But I’m not blaming her for\\nworking—someone had to bring home the bacon. It just meant I spent a great\\ndeal of time alone. (I would tell people I was a \\nlonely\\n child, having misheard\\nthe phrase “only child.”)\\nSo, I was a kid with a fast mind and an even faster mouth, but as said,\\nshe, too, had a fast mind and a fast mouth (I wonder where I got it from). We\\nargued a lot, and I always had to have the last word. One time, I was having\\nan argument with her in a stairwell, and she made me feel the most rage I’ve\\never felt in my life. (I was twelve years old, and you can’t hit your mother, so\\nthe rage turned inward—just like when I was an adult, at least I had the\\ndecency to turn into an alcoholic and an addict and not blame other people.)\\nI’ve always been abandoned. So much so that I used to ask my\\ngrandmother, when a plane went over our house in Ottawa, “Is my mother on\\nthat plane?” because I was always worried that she would disappear, just as\\nmy father had (she never did). My mother is beautiful; she was a star in every\\nroom she entered. And she’s certainly the reason I’m funny.\\nWith Dad off in California, Mom, being beautiful and smart and\\ncharismatic and the star in every room she entered, would date guys, and\\nthey’d date her right back, and sure enough, I’d turn every one of \\nthose men\\ninto my dad. Once again, when a plane went over our house, I’d ask my\\ngrandmother, “Is that [Michael] [Bill] [John] [insert name of Mom’s latest\\nbeau] flying away?” I was continually losing my father; I was continually\\nbeing dropped at the border. The roar of the Niagara River was forever in my\\nears, and not even a dose of phenobarbital could make it mute. My\\ngrandmother would coo at me, crack me open a can of Diet Coke, that faint-anise and distant-licorice filling my taste buds with loss.\\nAs for my \\nreal\\n dad, he would call every Sunday, which was nice. After\\nhis stint with the Serendipity Singers, he morphed his performing skills into\\nacting, first in New York, then in Hollywood. Though he was what they\\nsometimes call a journeyman, he was working pretty steadily and would\\neventually become the Old Spice guy. I saw his face more often on TV or in\\nmagazines than I did in reality. (Perhaps that’s why I became an actor.)\\n“What kind of man whistles the Old Spice tune? He’s my daddy!”\\n goes the\\nvoiceover from one 1986 ad as a little blond boy with a bowl cut puts his\\narms around my actual father’s neck. \\n“My practically perfect husband,”\\n the\\nsmiling blond wife intones, and though it’s sort of a joke, it was never very\\nfunny to me. \\n“You can count on him, he’s a friend.…”\\nThen, when enough time had passed that it was unseemly, I had a sign\\nthat read \\nUNACCOMPANIED MINOR\\n tied around my neck and I was taken to the\\nairport so I could be sent to Los Angeles. Whenever I’d visit him there, I’d\\nrealize over again each time that my dad was charismatic, funny, charming,\\nhyperhandsome.\\nHe was perfect, and even at that age, I liked things I could not have.\\nBottom line, though, was: my dad was my hero. In fact, he was my\\nsuper\\nhero: whenever we would go for walks, I would say “you be Superman\\nand I’ll be Batman.” (A smart psychologist might say we played roles instead\\nof Dad and Matthew, because our actual roles were too confusing to me. But\\nI couldn’t possibly comment on that.)\\nBack in Canada once again, the image of his face and the smell of his\\napartment would fade over the months. Then, it would be my birthday once\\nagain, and my mother would do what she could to make up for the fact that\\nmy dad wasn’t there, and when the too-big cake appeared, covered in many\\ndripping candles, each and every year I’d wish for one thing: in my head I’d\\nwhisper, \\nI want my parents to get back together.\\n Maybe if my home life had\\nbeen more stable, or if my dad had been around, or if he hadn’t been\\nSuperman, or if I hadn’t had a fast mind and mouth, or if Pierre Trudeau … I\\nwouldn’t be so damn uncomfortable all the time.\\nI’d be happy. And Diet Coke would be delicious instead of just necessary.\\nWithout the proper medicine, for my entire life I was uncomfortable allthe time and w-a-a-a-ay screwed up about love. To quote the great Randy\\nNewman, “It takes a whole lot of medicine for me to pretend that I’m\\nsomebody else.” I guess I wasn’t the only one.\\n“Hi, is Suzanne there?”\\n“Yes, can I tell my mom who’s calling?”\\n“It’s Pierre…”\\nWhen the phone rang, Mom and I had been in the middle of the \\nbest\\n day\\ntogether. We had played games all day long—we even tried to play\\nMonopoly, but it’s hard when there’s just two of you—and then as night fell,\\nwe found \\nAnnie Hall\\n on our little TV and laughed our asses off at Woody\\nAllen’s house under the roller coaster. (I didn’t get the sex and relationship\\njokes, but even at eight years old I could understand the comedy of sneezing\\naway $2,000 worth of some kind of white powder.)\\nThat is my absolute favorite childhood memory—sitting with my mom\\nand watching that movie. But now the prime minister of Canada was calling,\\nso I was about to lose my mom again. As she took the call \\nI heard her turn on\\nher professional, spinmeister-y voice; the voice of a different person, of\\nSuzanne Perry in fact, not my mom.\\nI turned the TV off and went to bed. I tucked myself in, and without the\\nneed of barbiturates—yet—I uneasily slept till early light illuminated my\\nOttawa bedroom window.\\nI remember around this time seeing my mother in the kitchen crying, and\\nI thought, \\nWhy doesn’t she just drink?\\n I have no idea how I got the notion\\nthat an alcoholic drink would stop crying. I certainly hadn’t had a drink by\\neight (I’d wait another six years!), but somehow the culture all around me\\nhad taught me that drinking equaled laughing and having fun, and a much-\\nneeded escape from pain. Mom was crying, so why didn’t she just drink?\\nThen she’d be drunk and not feel as much, right?\\nMaybe she was crying because we moved all the time—Montreal,\\nOttawa, Toronto—though I spent most of my childhood in Ottawa. I spent a\\nlot of time alone; there would be nannies, but they never lasted that long, so I\\njust added them to the list of people who abandoned me.… I just went onbeing funny, quick, smart-mouthed, just to survive.\\nBy standing next to Pierre Trudeau and looking beautiful, my mother\\nbecame an instant celebrity, so much so that she was offered the position of\\nanchoring the national news for Global Television, in Toronto.\\nWhat an opportunity—this was a job she could not pass up. She was\\npretty good at it, too, until one day when they were promoting a beauty\\npageant. My mother said, “I’m sure we’ll all be glued to \\nthat\\n one.” It was a\\nfunny line—and kind of surreal coming from a beauty pageant winner—but\\nshe was fired that night.\\nI hadn’t been happy with the move to Toronto—for starters, I hadn’t even\\nbeen included in the decision. And for the entrée, I would never see my\\nfriends again. My mother was also nine months pregnant—by then she had\\nmarried \\nCanada AM\\n host Keith Morrison—yes, him, the one with the hair on\\nNBC’s \\nDateline.\\n I had even been picked to give \\nmy mother away at the\\nwedding. This was an odd choice—figuratively and literally.\\nBut soon I had a beautiful sister! Caitlin was as cute as could be, and I\\nloved her instantly. But there was now a family growing up around me, a\\nfamily I didn’t really feel a part of. It was around this time that I made the\\nconscious choice to say, \\nFuck it—it’s every man for himself.\\n That’s when the\\nbad behavior started—I got shitty grades, I started smoking, I beat up Pierre’s\\nson (an eventual prime minister himself) Justin Trudeau. (I decided to end my\\nargument with him when he was put in charge of an entire army.) I made the\\nchoice to live in my head and not in my heart. It was safer in my head—you\\ncouldn’t be broken there, not yet anyway.\\nI changed. The fast mouth appeared, and no one would ever get near my\\nheart. No one.\\nI was ten years old.\\nBy seventh grade, we were back in Ottawa, where we belonged. I was\\nbeginning to see the power of making people laugh. At Ashbury College, my\\nall-boys secondary school in Ottawa, in between being the class cutup I\\nsomehow managed to land the role of Rackham, “the fastest gun in the\\nWest,” in a play called \\nThe Death and Life of Sneaky Fitch,\\n put on by the\\nschool’s drama teacher, Greg Simpson. It was a big part, and I just loved it—\\nmaking people laugh felt like everything. The ripple that turns into a wave,all those parents pretending to be interested in their kids’ exploits until—\\nwham!—that Perry kid actually made people laugh. (Of all the drugs, that\\none is still the most effective, at least when it comes to giving me \\njoy.\\n) Being\\nthe star of \\nThe Death and Life of Sneaky Fitch\\n was especially important\\nbecause it gave me something to excel in.\\nI deeply cared what strangers thought of me—still do—in fact, it’s one of\\nthe key threads in my life. I remember begging my mom to paint the\\nbackyard blue so people flying in planes overhead, looking down at our yard,\\nwould think we had a swimming pool. Maybe there \\nwas some\\nunaccompanied minor up there who could look down and be comforted by it.\\nEven though I was now a big brother, I was also the bad kid. One year I\\nwent through all the closets before Christmas to see what my presents were; I\\nwas also stealing money, smoking more and more, and getting worse and\\nworse grades. At one point the teachers put my desk facing the wall at the\\nback of the classroom because I talked so much and spent all my time trying\\nto make people laugh. One teacher, Dr. Webb, said, “If you don’t change the\\nway you are, you’ll never amount to anything.” (Should I admit that when I\\ngot the cover of \\nPeople\\n magazine I had a copy of it sent to Dr. Webb with a\\nnote that read, “I guess you were wrong”? Nah, that would be crass.)\\nI did.\\nMaking up for my shitty grades was the fact that I was the lead in every\\nplay and a nationally ranked tennis player.\\nMy grandfather started teaching me how to play tennis when I was four,\\nand by the time I was eight I knew I could beat him—but I waited until I was\\nten. I would play for eight to ten hours every day, and spend hours hitting at a\\nbackboard, too, pretending I was Jimmy Connors. I would play games and\\nsets, every shot of mine Connors, every return of the backboard John\\nMcEnroe. I hit the ball ahead of my body, I would sweep with my strings, I’d\\nput the racket behind me, as though I was placing it in a backpack. I figured it\\nwas only a matter of time before I’d be walking out at Wimbledon, nodding\\nsweetly and modestly at the adoring fans, limbering up before going to five\\nsets against McEnroe, waiting patiently while he berated some stuffy British\\numpire, before nailing a cross-court, backhand passing shot to win the\\ntournament. Then I’d kiss the golden trophy and sip a glass of RobinsonsBarley Water, a drink so far from Dr Pepper I would actually love it. Surely,\\nI’d get my mother’s attention then.\\n(The 1982 Wimbledon final, where Jimmy Connors narrowly beat\\nheavily favored John McEnroe, was my favorite match of all time. Jimmy\\ngraced the cover of \\nSports Illustrated\\n after his victory, and it’s framed and\\nhas hung on my wall to this day. I was him, or he was me—either way, on\\nthat day, both of us won.)\\nFor actual matches in the real world, I played at Rockcliffe Lawn Tennis\\nClub in Ottawa. You had to wear all whites at the club. At one point, there\\nwas a sign out front of the club that read \\nWHITES ONLY\\n until somebody\\nthought that might give the wrong impression. (The sign was quickly\\nchanged to \\nWHITE DRESS ONLY\\n and everyone moved on.) There were eight\\ncourts, mostly peopled by seniors, and I would spend all day waiting in the\\nclubhouse in case somebody didn’t show up and a fourth was needed and I\\ncould step in. The older folks loved me because I could get to every ball, but\\nI also had a crazy temper. I’d throw my racket and swear and get all pissed\\noff, and if I was losing badly, I would start sobbing. This usually preceded\\nme coming back to win—I’d be one set down; 5–1 down; love–40 down,\\nsobbing,\\n and then I’d come back to win in three. All along I’d be crying but\\nalso thinking, \\nI’m gonna win; I know I’m gonna win.\\n Winning wasn’t as\\nnecessary to others.\\nBy fourteen, I was nationally ranked in Canada … but that was also the\\nyear something else started.\\nI had my first drink when I was fourteen. I held off as long as I could.\\nAt this point I was hanging out a lot with two brothers, Chris and Brian\\nMurray. Somehow, since third grade we’d developed a way of talking that\\nwent, “Could it \\nbe\\n any hotter?” or “Could the teacher \\nbe\\n any meaner?” or\\n“Could we \\nbe\\n more in detention?”—a cadence you might recognize if you’re\\na fan of \\nFriends,\\n or if you’ve noticed how America has been talking for the\\npast couple of decades or so. (I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to suggest\\nthat Chandler Bing transformed the way America spoke.) For the record: that\\ntransformation came \\ndirectly from Matthew Perry, Chris Murray, and BrianMurray fucking around in Canada in the 1980s. Only I got rich off of it,\\nthough. Fortunately, Chris and Brian have never busted me for that and are\\nstill my dear, hilarious friends.\\nOne night, the three of us were hanging out in my backyard. No one was\\nhome; up above, the sun shone through the clouds, none of us knowing that\\nsomething extremely significant was about to transpire. I was lying in the\\ngrass and mud of Canada, and I didn’t know anything.\\nCould I \\nbe\\n more unaware?\\nWe decided to drink. I forget whose idea it was, and none of us knew\\nwhat we were getting ourselves into. We had a six-pack of Budweiser and a\\nbottle of white wine called Andrès Baby Duck. I took the wine and the\\nMurrays took the beer. All this took place in the wide open, by the way—we\\nwere just in my backyard. My parents weren’t home—big surprise there—\\nand off we went.\\nWithin fifteen minutes, all the alcohol was gone. The Murrays were\\npuking around me, and I just lay in the grass, and something happened to me.\\nThat thing that makes me bodily and mentally different from my fellows\\noccurred. I was lying back in the grass and the mud, looking at the moon,\\nsurrounded by fresh Murray puke, and I realized that for the first time in my\\nlife, nothing bothered me. The world made sense; it wasn’t bent and crazy. I\\nwas complete, at peace. I had never been happier than in that moment. \\nThis is\\nthe answer,\\n I thought; \\nthis is what I’ve been missing. This must be how\\nnormal people feel all the time. I don’t have any problems. It is all gone. I\\ndon’t need attention. I am taken care of, I am fine.\\nI was in \\nbliss.\\n I had no problems for those three hours. I wasn’t\\nabandoned; I wasn’t fighting with my mom; I wasn’t doing lousy in school; I\\nwasn’t wondering what life was about, and my place in it. It took away\\neverything.\\nKnowing what I know now about the progressive nature of the disease of\\naddiction, it’s amazing to me I didn’t drink the \\nnext\\n night, and \\nthe next night,\\ntoo, but I didn’t—I waited, and the scourge of alcoholism hadn’t gripped me\\nyet. So that first night didn’t lead to regular drinking, but it probably sowed\\nthe seed.\\nThe key to the problem, I would come to understand, was this: I lackedboth spiritual guidelines, and an ability to enjoy anything. But at the same\\ntime, I was also an excitement addict. This is such a toxic combination I can’t\\neven.\\nI didn’t know this at the time, of course, but if I was not in the act of\\nsearching for excitement, being excited, or drunk, I was incapable of\\nenjoying anything. The fancy word for that is “anhedonia,” a word and\\nfeeling I would spend millions in therapy and treatment centers to discover\\nand understand. Maybe that’s why I won tennis matches only when I was a\\nset down and within points of losing. Maybe that’s why I did everything I\\ndid. \\nAnhedonia,\\n by the way, was the original working title of my favorite\\nmovie, the one my mother and I had enjoyed together, \\nAnnie Hall.\\n Woody\\ngets it. Woody gets me.\\nThings at home just got worse and worse. My mom had a wonderful new\\nfamily with Keith. Emily arrived, and she was blond and cute as a button.\\nAnd just like Caitlin, I loved her instantly. However, I was so often on the\\noutside looking in, still that kid up in the clouds on a flight to somewhere\\nelse, unaccompanied. Mom and I were fighting all the time; tennis was the\\nonly place I was happy, and even then, I was angry, or sobbing, even when I\\nwon. What was a fella to do?\\nEnter, my father. I wanted to know him. It was time for a big geographic.\\nYup, Los Angeles, and my father, and a new life were calling, but I was\\nfifteen, and leaving would rupture my home life and my mom’s \\nheart. But\\nshe didn’t ask me if it was OK to marry Keith and move to Toronto and have\\ntwo kids.… And in Canada I was angry, and sobbing, and drinking, and me\\nand my mom were fighting, and I wasn’t a full part of the family, and I\\nsucked at school, and who knew if I was going to have to move soon anyway,\\nand on and on and on. And damn it, a kid wants to know his father.\\nI decided to go. My parents had discussed it and wondered if LA would\\nbe better for my tennis career anyway. (Little did I know that in SouthernCalifornia the best I’d be would be a solid club player, the standard being so\\nmuch higher in a place where you can play 365 days a year, as opposed to\\nCanada, where you’re lucky if you get a couple of months before the\\npermafrost shows up.) But even with that idea, me deciding to go caused a\\ngreat rift in the fabric of my family.\\nThe night before I made the trip, I was in the basement of our house,\\nwhere I slept that night only, and it would turn out to be one of the worst\\nnights of my life. Up in the main house, hell was brewing; there was the\\nbanging of doors, and hissed conversations, and occasional shouts, and\\npacing, and one of the kids was crying, and no one could stop it. My\\ngrandparents would periodically come down and yell at me; upstairs, my\\nmother was screaming, crying, and then all the kids were crying, and my\\ngrandparents were yelling, and the kids were yelling, and I was down there,\\nmute, abandoned, determined, terrified, unaccompanied, and scared. These\\nthree very powerful adults would come down to tell me over and over that I\\nwas breaking their hearts by leaving. But I had no choice; things had gotten\\nso bad. I was a broken human being.\\nBroken? Bent.\\nEarly next morning, in what must have been a very difficult drive for her,\\nmy mother was kind enough to take me to the airport and watch me fly away\\nfrom her for the rest of her life. How I had the cour\\nage to actually make this\\nvoyage is beyond me. I still question whether or not it was the right thing to\\ndo.\\nStill an unaccompanied minor—but a pro by now—I flew to LA to get to\\nknow my father. I was so terrified that even the hoopla of Hollywood might\\nnot to be able to soothe me. But soon I would see the lights of the city and\\nhave a parent once more.INTERLUDE\\nNew York\\nThe first thing I did when I got home from those five months in the hospital\\nwas light up a cigarette. After all that time, the inhale, the smoke billowing\\ninto my lungs, was like the first cigarette I had ever had in my entire life. It\\nfelt like a second homecoming.\\nI was no longer in Pain—the massive surgery on my stomach had caused\\nscar tissue, which in turn caused my stomach to feel like I was doing a sit-up\\nat full stretch 24/7, but it wasn’t actually pain. It was more of an annoyance.\\nBut no one needed to know that, so I told everyone I was in pain so I\\ncould get OxyContin. Pretty soon the 80 milligrams a day of OxyContin I had\\nconned them into giving me wasn’t working anymore, and I needed more.\\nWhen I asked the doctors for more, they said no; when I called a drug dealer,\\nhe said yes. Now all I had to do was figure out a way to get down forty floors\\nfrom my $20 million penthouse apartment without Erin spotting me. (I\\nbought the place—I swear to God—because Bruce Wayne lived in just such\\nan apartment in \\nThe Dark Knight.\\n)\\nOver the next month I attempted to do this four times. I was caught—you\\nguessed it—four times. I was horrible at it. Naturally, the \\ncall came down\\nfrom above that this man needs to go to rehab again. So—\\nAfter the explosion of my bowel, I’d been through a first surgery and\\nneeded to wear a rather attractive colostomy bag—a look even I couldn’t pull\\noff. There was a second surgery pending, to remove the bag, but in between\\nthe two surgeries, I was banned from smoking (smokers tend to have much\\nuglier scars, hence the stricture). Not to mention I was missing my two front\\nteeth—a bite into a piece of toast with peanut butter had cracked them and Ihadn’t had time to fix them yet.\\nSo let me get this straight: you’re asking me to quit doing drugs and quit\\nsmoking at the same time? I didn’t give a fuck about the scars; I am a big\\nsmoker; this was too much to ask. What this meant was that I had to go to a\\nrehab in New York, quit OxyContin, and quit smoking, simultaneously, and I\\nwas scared.\\nOnce I got to rehab, they gave me Subutex for the detox, so that wasn’t\\nthat bad. I checked into my room, and the clock started. By day four I was\\ngoing out of my mind, this had always been the hardest day. I realized how\\nserious they were going to be about this smoking thing, too. It was decided\\nthat I could smoke while in detox, but once I moved up to the third floor the\\nsmokes had to go.\\nThey insisted, so much so that I was locked in the building so I could not\\nget out. I was on the third floor; all around, New York purred in the distance,\\ngoing about its business, living life while their favorite sarcastic sitcom star\\nwas in hell one more time. If I listened hard enough, I could just hear the\\nsubway—the F train, the R train, the 4, 5, 6—deep below me, or maybe it\\nwas the rattle of something else, something unbidden and terrifying and\\nunstoppable.\\nThis rehab was prison, I was convinced of it. A real prison, not like the\\none I had made up before. Red bricks, black iron bars. Somehow, I’d found\\nmy way to jail. I’d never broken the law—well, I’d never been caught—\\nnevertheless, here I was, in lockup, pokey, the House of D. \\nMissing my two\\nfront teeth, I even looked like a convict, and every counselor was a guard.\\nThey may as well have fed me through a slot in a bolted door.\\nI hated the whole place—they didn’t have anything to teach me. I’ve been\\nin therapy since I was eighteen years old, and honestly, by this point, I didn’t\\nneed any more therapy—what I needed was two front teeth and a colostomy\\nbag that didn’t break. When I say that I woke up covered in my own shit, I’m\\ntalking fifty to sixty times. On the mornings when the bag did not break, I\\nnoticed another new phenomenon: when I woke up, I enjoyed about thirty\\nseconds of freedom as I slowly wiped the sleep from my eyes and then the\\nreality of my situation would hit me, and I would burst into tears at a rate that\\nwould even make Meryl Streep jealous.Oh, and I needed a cigarette. Did I mention that?\\nI was sitting in my room doing God knows what on day four when\\nsomething hit me, I don’t know what. It was like something was punching me\\nfrom the inside. But even though I had been in therapy for more than thirty\\nyears and it had nothing new to teach me, I had to do something to get my\\nmind off nicotine, so I left my cell and headed down the hallway. Aimless, I\\nhad no idea what I was doing or where I was going.\\nI think I was trying to walk outside of my own body.\\nI knew that all the therapists were on the floor below me, but I decided to\\nskip the elevator and make for the stairwell. I didn’t really know what was\\nhappening—I can’t to this day describe what was going on, except that I was\\nin a sort of panic, confusion, a kind of fugue state, and there was that intense\\npain again—not Pain, but pretty close to it. Total confusion. And I wanted to\\nsmoke so badly. So, I stopped, in that stairwell, and thought about all the\\nyears of agony, and the fact that the yard never got painted blue, and Pierre\\nfucking Trudeau, and the fact that I was then, and still am, an unaccompanied\\nminor.\\nIt was like the bad parts of my life were appearing to me all at once.\\nI’ll never be able to fully explain what happened next, but all of a sudden,\\nI started slamming my head against the wall, as hard as humanly possible.\\nFifteen–love. SLAM! Thirty–love. SLAM! Forty–love. SLAM! Game. Ace\\nafter ace, volley after perfect volley, my head the ball, the wall the cement\\ncourt, all the pain lobbed up but short, me reaching up, smashing my head\\nagainst the wall, blood on the cement and on the wall, and all over my face,\\ncompleting the Grand Slam, the umpire screaming, “GAME, SET, AND\\nMATCH, UNACCOMPANIED MINOR, SIX LOVE, NEEDS LOVE, SIX\\nLOVE. SCARED OF LOVE.”\\nThere was blood everywhere.\\nAfter about eight of these mind-numbing slams, somebody must have\\nheard me, and stopped me, and asked the only logical question:\\n“Why are you doing that?”\\nI gazed at her, and looking like Rocky Balboa from every one of those\\nlast scenes, I said, “Because I couldn’t think of anything better to do.”\\nStairwells.2\\nAnother Generation Shot to Hell\\nIt seemed like the whole world was walking through the arrivals lounge of\\nLAX that summer.\\nWorld-class amateur gymnasts, sprinters, discus throwers, pole vaulters,\\nbasketball players, weight lifters, show jumpers and their horses, swimmers,\\nfencers, soccer players, synchronized swimmers, media from all around the\\nglobe, officials and sponsors and agents … oh, and one fifteen-year-old also-\\namateur tennis player from Canada, they all washed up in Los Angeles during\\nthe summer of 1984, though only one was doing a big geographic.\\nThat was the year of the Los Angeles Olympic Games, a golden time of\\nhigh sun and muscled excellence, of a hundred thousand people packed into\\nthe Coliseum and the Rose Bowl, where Mary Lou Retton needed a 10 to win\\nthe gymnastics all-around and nailed it, and where Carl Lewis won four gold\\nmedals by running really fast and jumping really far.\\nIt was also the year I immigrated to the United States, a lost Canadian \\nkid\\nwith a dick that didn’t seem to work, heading to Tinseltown to live with his\\nfather.\\nBack in Ottawa, before I’d left, a girl had tried to have sex with me, but I\\nwas so nervous that I drank six beers beforehand and couldn’t perform. By\\nthen I’d been drinking for a few years—it began soon after the time I gave\\nmy mother away to that lovely man, Keith.\\nAnd I do mean lovely. Keith \\nlived\\n for my mother. The only thing that is\\nannoying about Keith is that he always takes my mother’s side. He is her\\nprotector. I can’t tell you how many times my mother has done something\\nthat I may have taken issue with and I’ve been told by Keith that it neverhappened. Some would call this gaslighting, others would call it gaslighting\\n—it’s gaslighting. But my family was held together by one man, and that was\\nKeith Morrison.\\nAnyway, back to my penis.\\nI failed to make the correlation between the booze and my private parts\\nnot working. And no one could know about this—no one. So, I was walking\\naround the planet thinking sex was something for \\nother\\n people. For a long\\ntime; years. Sex sounded awfully fun, but it was not in my arsenal. This\\nmeant, in my mind and pants at least, that I was (con)genitally, impotent.\\nIf I just go to Los Angeles, I’ll be happy.…\\n That’s what I thought.\\nSeriously—that’s what I thought a geographic, long before I even knew what\\na geographic was, would do for me. I fit right in with the muscled,\\nhypertrained athletes also waiting at the baggage carousels. Weren’t we all\\njust bringing some kind of crazy dream to this crazy city? If there were a\\nhundred sprinters, and only three medals per discipline, how much saner\\ncould you say they were than me? In fact, I probably had a better chance of\\nmaking it in my profession than they did in theirs—after all, my dad was an\\nactor, and that’s what I wanted to be. All he had to do was help me push on\\ndoors already ajar, right? And so what \\nif I came halfway down the pack—I\\nmight not get a medal either, but at least I’d get away from Ottawa and a dick\\nthat didn’t seem to want to work. And a family I wasn’t really a part of and\\non and on.\\nThe initial plan for me had involved sports, too. My tennis had advanced\\nto the point where we seriously considered me enrolling in Nick Bollettieri’s\\nTennis Academy in Florida. Bollettieri was the premier tennis coach—he\\nhelped Monica Seles, Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, and Venus and Serena\\nWilliams among many others—but once in LA, it quickly became apparent\\nthat I was going to be a perfectly solid club player, nothing more. I can\\nremember enrolling in a satellite tournament, with my dad and my new\\nfamily watching (he’d remarried to Debbie, a lovely woman, and the catch of\\nthe century, in 1980, and back then they had a very young daughter, Maria),\\nand in my first match I didn’t win a \\nsingle\\n point.\\nThe standard in Southern California was off the charts—when it’s\\nseventy-two degrees every day, and there are tennis courts seemingly inevery backyard and on every street corner, some kid from the icy wastes of\\nCanada—where it’s subzero from December through March, if you’re lucky\\n—is going to struggle to make an impact. It was kind of like being a really\\ngood hockey player in Burbank. And so it turned out: my dreams of being the\\nnext Jimmy Connors quickly faded when faced with whipped 100-mph\\nserves coming from bronzed Californian gods who happened to be eleven\\nyears old and called Chad, but spelled with a capital \\nD\\n.\\nIt was time to look for a new profession.\\nDespite this swift reality check, I loved LA instantly. I loved the vastness\\nof it, the possibilities of it, the opportunity to start anew—not to mention that\\nthe seventy-two degrees every day made a nice change from Ottawa. Plus,\\nwhen I realized that tennis wasn’t going to be how I would make a living, and\\nsomeone told me people actually get paid to act, I quickly changed career\\ngoals. This wasn’t as far-fetched as it seemed; for a start, my dad was in show\\nbusiness, and I had a hunch that the at\\ntention would light me up like a\\nChristmas tree. I had had a solid training at home; whenever there was\\ntension, or I needed attention, I’d honed my skills at delivering a killer line. If\\nI was performing well, everything was safe, and I was being taken care of. I\\nmight have been an unaccompanied minor, but when I got laughs, there was a\\nwhole audience—my mother, my siblings, the Murray brothers, kids in\\nschool—who would stand and applaud me. It also didn’t hurt that three\\nweeks into my sophomore year at a very prestigious and expensive (thanks,\\nDad) new school, I was cast in the lead role of the high school play. That’s\\nright ladies and gentlemen—you are looking at George Gibbs in Thornton\\nWilder’s \\nOur Town\\n. Acting came naturally to me. Why wouldn’t I want to\\npretend to be another person?\\nJesus Christ …\\nI think my dad had sensed this was going to happen. After I was cast in\\nOur Town,\\n I raced home to share the big news and found a book lying on my\\nbed called \\nActing with Style.\\n The inscription inside read:\\nAnother generation shot to hell. Love, Dad.\\nActing was another one of my drugs. And it didn’t do the damage that\\nalcohol was already starting to do. In fact, it was getting harder and harder towake up after a night of drinking. Not on school days—it hadn’t escalated\\nthat far yet. But certainly, every weekend.\\nBut first, I had to get a regular education.\\nI was the pale Canadian kid with a quick mouth, and there’s something\\nabout an outsider that piques the curiosity of teenagers—we seem exotic,\\nespecially if we have a Canadian accent and can name the entire roster of the\\nToronto Maple Leafs. Plus, my dad was the Old Spice guy; for years on their\\nTVs, my schoolmates had seen Dad dressed as a sailor \\non shore leave—\\nreplete with peacoat and black sailor cap—slinging that iconic white bottle at\\nclean-shaven bit actors while urging them to “Clean up your life with Old\\nSpice!” It may not have been Shakespeare, but he was famous enough, and he\\nwas tall and handsome and very funny, and he was my dad.\\nDad was also a drinker. Every evening he’d arrive home from whichever\\nset he’d been on, or \\nnot\\n been on, pour himself a healthy slug of vodka tonic,\\nand announce, “This is the best thing that’s happened to me all day.”\\nHe said this about a drink. Sitting next to his son on a couch in Los\\nAngeles. Then he’d have four more and take the fifth to bed.\\nDad taught me many good things, too. But he certainly taught me how to\\ndrink. It’s still no accident that my drink of choice was a double vodka tonic,\\nand my thought every time was, \\nThis is the best thing that happened to me all\\nday.\\nThere was a difference, though—a big one. Without fail, next morning at\\nseven Dad would be up, bright and breezy; he’d shower and apply his\\naftershave (never Old Spice), and head out to the bank or his agent or to set—\\nhe never missed a thing. Dad was the epitome of a functional drinker. I, on\\nthe other hand, was already struggling to wake up and causing whispers with\\nthose who drank around me.\\nI watched my father drink six vodka tonics and live a perfectly functional\\nlife, so, I figured it was possible. I figured I’d be able to do the same thing.\\nBut there was something lurking in my shadows and my genes, like a creepy\\nbeast in a dark place, something I had that my father did not, and it would be\\na decade before we knew what it was. Alcoholism, addiction—you call itwhat you want, I’ve chosen to call it a Big Terrible Thing.\\nBut I was George Gibbs, too.\\nI don’t remember what my classmates thought of this newbie showing up\\nwith his pale skin and Canadian brogue, but I didn’t \\ncare. SparkNotes\\ndescribes Gibbs as “an archetypal all-American boy. A local baseball star and\\nthe president of his senior class in high school, he also possesses innocence\\nand sensitivity. He is a good son … [but for] George [to] stifle his emotions\\nis difficult, if not impossible.”\\nSo, pretty much dead-on, then.\\nAt home, though, my dad had vodka all over the house. One afternoon,\\nwhen he and Debbie were gone, I decided to take a big swig of vodka. As the\\nwarm spice of it jangled down my throat and innards, I felt that well-being,\\nthat ease, that sense that everything was going to be fine, I saw the clouds\\nfrom my backyard in Ottawa and I figured I’d head out into LA, to walk in\\nthis bliss, this seventy-two-degree heaven, the star of the school play\\nwandering like a drunk Odysseus through the star-studded streets. Clancy\\nSigal, writing for the London \\nObserver\\n about the 1984 LA Olympics, noted\\nthat whenever he visited the city, he sensed that he was “passing through a\\nsoft membrane that seals Los Angeles off from the real, painful world.” Here\\nI was, too, slipping through that soft, vodka-softened membrane, into a place\\nwhere there was no pain, where the world was both real, and not … and yet,\\nas I turned a corner, something else hit me that had never occurred to me\\nbefore—death, fear of death, questions like “Why are we all here?” “What’s\\nthe meaning of all this?” “What’s the point?” “How do we all arrive at this?”\\n“What are human beings?” “What is air?” All these questions poured into my\\nbrain like a tidal wave.\\nI was just rounding a fucking corner!\\nThe drink, and that walk, opened a chasm in me that’s still there. I was so\\ntroubled; I was an extremely screwed up guy. The questions cascaded like\\nalcohol into a glass; all I’d done was what Sigal had done—I had arrived in\\nLos Angeles, along with gymnasts and sprinters and horses and writers and\\nactors and wannabes and has-beens and Old Spice actors, and now, a greatvoid had opened up beneath me. I was standing at the \\nedge of great pit of fire,\\nlike “The Pit of Hell” in the Karakum Desert of central Turkmenistan. The\\ndrink, and that walk, had created a thinker, a seeker, but not some soft-focus,\\nBuddhist crap—one who was on the edge of a deep crater of flames, haunted\\nby the lack of answers, by being \\nunaccompanied,\\n by wanting love but being\\nterrified of abandonment, by wanting excitement, but being unable to\\nappreciate it, by a dick that didn’t work. I was face-to-face with the four last\\nthings: death, judgment, heaven, and hell, a fifteen-year-old boy brought up\\nclose to the face of eschatology, so close he could smell the vodka on its\\nbreath.\\nYears later, my father, too, would take his own meaningful walk: he had\\nhad a bad night on the drink where he fell through some bushes or something,\\nand he talked to Debbie about it the following morning and she said, “Is this\\nthe way you want to live your life?” And he said, no—then he went for a\\nwalk and quit drinking and hasn’t had a drop since.\\nExcuse me? You went for a walk and quit drinking? I have spent upward\\nof $7 million trying to get sober. I have been to six thousand AA meetings.\\n(Not an exaggeration, more an educated guess.) I’ve been to rehab fifteen\\ntimes. I’ve been in a mental institution, gone to therapy twice a week for\\nthirty years, been to death’s door. And you went for a fucking walk?\\nI’ll tell you where you can take a walk.\\nBut my dad can’t write a play, star on \\nFriends,\\n help the helpless. And he\\ndoesn’t have $7 million to spend on anything. Life has its trade-offs, I\\nsuppose.\\nThis begs the question—would I trade places with him?\\nWhy don’t we get to that one later?\\nOn the jukebox, I’d put a few dimes in and play “Don’t Give Up” by Peter\\nGabriel and Kate Bush over and over; sometimes I’d slip in \\n“Mainstreet” by\\nBob Seger, or “Here Comes the Sun” by the Beatles. One of the reasons we\\nloved the 101 Coffee Shop was because they kept the jukebox up-to-date;\\nplus, it felt like old Hollywood in there, with its caramel-colored leather\\nbooths and the sense that at any moment someone super famous might walkin—you know, to pretend that fame didn’t change anything.\\nBy 1986, I was pretty sure fame would change everything, and I yearned\\nfor it more than any other person on the face of the planet. I \\nneeded\\n it. It was\\nthe only thing that would fix me. I was certain of it. Living in LA you would\\noccasionally bump into a celebrity, or you’d see Billy Crystal at the Improv,\\nmake note of Nicolas Cage in the next booth, and I just knew they had no\\nproblems—in fact, all their problems had been washed away. They were\\nfamous.\\nI’d been auditioning steadily and had even gotten a gig or two—most\\nnotably, in the first season of \\nCharles in Charge\\n. I played Ed, a preppy,\\nplaid-sweater-and-tie-wearing square who confidently intoned his one main\\nline: “My father’s a Princeton man, and a surgeon—I’d like to follow in his\\nfootsteps!” But it was work, and TV, and without much more thought I found\\nthat I was already skipping school to hang out in diners with girls who liked\\nmy accent and my quick patter and my budding TV career and my ability to\\nlisten to them. Thanks to my training back in Canada, I knew I was able to\\nlisten to and help women in crisis. (If you’re a woman and you are in duress\\nand you sing a song about it, I will listen to it over and over and over.) So\\nthere I was, in the 101 Coffee Shop, holding court with a gaggle of young\\nwomen, quick with a line and a smirk and a willing ear; I’d ditched the\\npreppy, \\nCharles in Charge\\n look as soon as I’d left the Universal lot in Studio\\nCity and was dressed like any cool teen in the mid-1980s: denim jacket over\\na plaid shirt, or probably wearing a Kinks T-shirt before going home to listen\\nto Air Supply.\\nWhen you’re nearly sixteen, days seem endless, especially when \\nyou’re\\ncharming a bunch of young women in a greasy spoon in Hollywood. I must\\nhave been really on that day, too, because as I joked around, a middle-aged\\nguy walked past the booth and put a note on a napkin in front of me on the\\ntable and walked away and right out the door. The girls all stopped\\nchattering; I looked at the guy’s back as he left, then did a prototype of\\nChandler’s double take, getting more laughs.\\n“Well, read it!” one of the girls said.\\nI carefully picked up the note as though it were covered in poison, and\\nslowly opened it. In spidery handwriting it said,I want you to be in my next movie. Please give me a call at this\\nnumber.… William Richert.\\n“What does it say?” another girl said.\\n“It says, ‘Could you be more handsome and talented?’” I said, deadpan.\\n“No,” the first girl said, “it does \\nnot\\n!”\\nThe tenor of her disbelief caused another round of laughter as I said, “Oh,\\nthanks \\nvery\\n much,” but once the laughter died down, I said, “It says, ‘I want\\nyou to be in my next movie. Please give me a call at this number. William\\nRichert.’”\\nOne of the girls said, “Well, \\nthat\\n sounds legitimate.…”\\n“Right?” I said. “This movie is going to be shot in the back of a\\nwindowless van.”\\nAt home that evening, I asked my dad what to do. He was on his third\\nvodka tonic—there was just enough cogency left in his tank to get a useful\\nanswer. By now, he was starting to get a little frustrated by the fact that my\\ncareer was beginning to percolate; he wasn’t jealous, but he was aware that I\\nwas younger than he was, and that the road was rising to meet me, and that if\\nI played my cards right, I might have \\na better career than the one he was\\nhaving. That said, he never showed anything but support—there was no\\n“Great Santini” going on here. My dad was my hero, and he was proud of\\nme.\\n“Well, Matty,” he said, “can’t hurt to call.”\\nBut whatever my dad said, I knew I’d call that number. I’d known it\\nwhen I first read the note. This was Hollywood, after all—that’s supposed to\\nbe how it happens, right?\\nIt turned out that William Richert didn’t want to make a movie in the back of\\na van.\\nRichert had been watching me perform for the girls that day in the 101\\nand had seen enough of \\nThe Matthew Perry Show\\n to want to cast me in a\\nmovie he was making based on his novel \\nA Night in the Life of Jimmy\\nReardon.\\n The novel and the movie are set in Chicago in the early 1960s;Reardon is a teenager who is being forced to go to business school when all\\nhe really wants to do is get enough money to buy a plane ticket to Hawaii,\\nwhere his girlfriend lives. I was to play Reardon’s best friend, Fred Roberts,\\nwho, like Ed in \\nCharles in Charge,\\n was well-off and a bit snobby, and\\nsuffered from chronic virginity. (I could relate.) I ditched the preppy look\\nonce again, as Fred was to be dressed in a gray felt flat cap and leather jacket\\nover a dress shirt and tie, oh, and black leather gloves. In the movie, the\\ncharacter of Reardon sleeps with my girlfriend, but that’s OK, because\\nplaying Reardon would be someone it would be a privilege to be cheated on\\nby.\\nThe list of geniuses who were ahead of their time is too long to detail here\\n—suffice to say, near the top of any such list should be my costar in \\nA Night\\nin the Life of Jimmy Reardon,\\n River Phoenix. This movie was my first job,\\nand I’m acutely aware it would be a better story if the movie was a huge hit,\\nbut all that really matters is that I learned how to make a film, and I got to\\nknow River, who personified beauty \\nin every way. There was an aura around\\nthat guy. But he made you feel too comfortable to even be jealous of him.\\nStand by Me\\n had just come out—which he \\nexcelled\\n in—and when you\\nwalked into a room with him, his charisma was such that you instantly\\nbecame part of the furniture.\\nThe movie was shot in Chicago, so there I was, just turning seventeen\\nyears old, and heading to the Windy City, sans parents, sans anything, once\\nagain an unaccompanied minor, but this time it felt like freedom, like what I\\nwas born to do. I had never been so excited in my life. It was in Chicago, and\\non this movie, and with River Phoenix, that I fell deeply in love with acting\\n—and the cherry on top of this deeply magical time was that River and I\\nbecame firm friends. He and I drank beer and shot pool on North Rush Street\\n(\\nThe Color of Money\\n had just come out, and pool was the thing to do). We\\nhad a per diem; we flirted with girls, though that’s as far as it went for me\\nbecause, well, you know.\\nRiver was a beautiful man, inside and out—too beautiful for this world, it\\nturned out. It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down. Why\\nis it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but\\nKeanu Reeves still walks among us? River was a better actor than me; I wasfunnier. But I certainly held my own in our scenes—no small feat, when I\\nlook back decades later. But more important, River just looked at the world in\\na different way than we all did, and that made him fascinating, and\\ncharismatic, and, yes, beautiful, but not in a Gap ad kinda way (though he\\nwas that, too)—in a there-is-no-one-else-in-the-world-like-him kind of way.\\nNot to mention he was rocketing to stardom, yet you would never know it.\\nAnd somewhere in all that magic, River Phoenix and I managed to shoot\\na movie together.\\nLater, River would say that he wasn’t happy with his performance in\\nJimmy Reardon,\\n claiming he hadn’t been the right person for the role. \\nBut to\\nme he was the right person for every role. He could do anything. I remember\\nseeing him in the movie \\nSneakers\\n—he was making choices no one else\\nwould make. Not to mention holding his own with legends like Robert\\nRedford and the wonderful Sidney Poitier. (If you haven’t seen it, you should\\n—it’s highly entertaining.)\\nThe movie \\nwe\\n made would eventually tank at the box office, but it didn’t\\nmatter. We’d been somewhere beautiful and magical, even if it was just\\nNorth Rush Street in freezing Chicago. And it was the best experience of my\\nlife—I knew it, too. My work was done in about three weeks, but they\\n(probably River, actually) liked me so much that they kept me on the movie\\ntill the end. Things didn’t get better than this.\\nOne night, alone in my tiny room at the Tremont hotel, as things were\\ndrawing to a close, I knelt down and said to the universe: “Don’t you ever\\nforget this.”\\nAnd I have not.\\nBut magic never lasts; whatever holes you’re filling seem to keep opening\\nback up. (It’s like Whac-A-Mole.) Maybe it was because I was always trying\\nto fill a spiritual hole with a material thing.… I don’t know. Either way, when\\nit came to the last day of shooting, I sat on my bed in my Chicago hotel room\\nand cried. I sobbed and sobbed because I knew even then I would never again\\nhave an experience like that—my first movie, far from home, free to flirt and\\ndrink and hang out with a brilliant young man like River Phoenix.\\nI would sob again seven years later on Halloween 1993, when River died\\nin front of the Viper Room in West Hollywood. (I heard the screaming frommy apartment; went back to bed; woke up to the news.) After his passing, his\\nmom wrote, in reference to drug use, “the spirits of [River’s] generation are\\nbeing worn down,” and by then, I was drinking every night. But it would be\\nyears before I understood exactly what she meant.\\nWith \\nJimmy Reardon\\n in the can, I flew back to LA from Chicago \\nand\\nreturned to planet Earth in the form of high school. I was still auditioning for\\ntons of things but wasn’t getting much traction. I was booking mostly\\ncomedy stuff, and I ended up guest starring on just about everything. My\\ngrades still sucked, though. I graduated with a 2.0 average, exactly. All that I\\nasked for my graduation was that my mother and father both attend, which\\nthey kindly did. The incredibly awkward dinner that followed seemed only to\\nunderline the fact that the child they shared was destined to be uncomfortable\\nas a default, even though he was also usually the funniest person in the room.\\nBut that night at dinner I was only the third funniest, and the third most\\nbeautiful. At least a childhood dream of them being together had come true, if\\nfor one night only, and even then, if only in embarrassing silences and barbs\\npassed back and forth like some angry cosmic joint.\\nI am grateful to my parents for attending that dinner—it was an incredibly\\nkind and completely unnecessary thing for them to do. But it crystallized\\nsomething for me that I had not anticipated. It was \\nright\\n that they weren’t\\ntogether. They were not to be. They were correct to be apart. They both\\nsubsequently found the person they were meant to be with. And I am\\nincredibly happy for both of them. Matty no longer needed to make the wish\\nthat his parents would be together.\\nIt would be decades before they were in the same room together again.\\nAnd then, for a very different reason.\\nThe acting roles, and the quick mind and mouth, and the friendship with\\nRiver, and the denim jacket over plaid shirt all combined to help me land a\\nbeautiful girlfriend named Tricia Fisher. (Eddie Fisher and Connie Stevens’s\\ndaughter—that’s right, Carrie Fisher’s half sister. This girl was no stranger to\\ncharm.)\\nThe rhyming poetry of her name alone should have made her irresistible—plus, I was eighteen now, and was pretty sure everything \\nworked, except\\nwhen I was in the company of another human being. I carried impotence\\naround with me like a great ugly secret, like I carried around everything else.\\nAccordingly, as my relationship with Tricia Fisher deepened, thoughts\\nnaturally turned to a physical consummation, but I announced confidently\\nthat like a Roman Catholic, I wanted to wait—not many eighteen-year-old\\nmales say that, by the way, nor should they. This, of course, caught her\\ninterest. When she pressed me on why, I said something about “commitment”\\nor “the future” or “the state of the planet” or “my career,” anything, in fact, to\\navoid telling her that I was softer than the caramel-colored booths at the 101\\nCoffee Shop when push came to shove. And I couldn’t let push come to\\nshove or my secret would be out.\\nMy firmness, at least in my conviction to wait, lasted two months. But\\ndams burst, and the make-out sessions that didn’t lead anywhere were\\nbeginning to cause us both to hyperventilate. Tricia Fisher made up her mind.\\n“Matty,” she said, “I’ve had enough of this. Let’s go.”\\nShe took my hand and led me to the bed in my tiny studio apartment in\\nWestwood.\\nI was horrified, and also excited, though I was still haunted by an inner\\ndialogue of fear:\\n—Maybe this time, and with someone I care deeply for, my previous\\ninabilities will dissolve.…\\n Dissolve—bad word.\\n—Should I have a stiff drink beforehand?\\n Well, stiff’s the problem, pal.\\n—Maybe it won’t be as hard as I feared.\\n Not as hard? Matty, stop doing\\nthat.…\\nBefore this brief dialogue could turn into a threepenny opera, Tricia had\\ndisrobed both of us and pulled us into bed. I distinctly remember the foothills\\nof lovemaking as pure bliss, but like a neophyte \\nmountaineer, I feared that\\nbeyond a certain base camp, no amount of oxygen would help me get any\\nhigher. And so it proved to be. How else to put it?—I just couldn’t get that\\nthing to work right. I thought of everything, spinning complex, erotic images\\nthrough my addled brain, hoping to land on something—\\none thing, that’s all\\nit will take!\\n—that would firm up my commitment to future bliss. Nothingworked; nothing. Horrified yet again, I forsook the loving arms of Tricia\\nFisher and padded my slim, naked body over to a chair in the apartment. (It\\nwas like you could bend me in half if you wanted to.) I sat there, soft, and\\nsad, my two hands cupped over my lap like a nun’s during Vespers, doing my\\nbest to cover my embarrassment and maybe a tear or two.\\nTricia Fisher was once again having none of it.\\n“Matty!” she said. “What the hell is going on? Don’t you find me\\nattractive?”\\n“Oh, no, of course I find you attractive!” I said. The physical issues were\\nbad enough, but worse, I could feel an escalating sense of abandonment\\nslipping in through the windows of that room. What if Tricia left me? What if\\nI wasn’t enough, like I always wasn’t enough? What if I was destined to be\\nunaccompanied again?\\nI was desperate; I really liked her; and I really wanted to believe that love\\ncould save me.\\nThere was only one thing to do. I had to tell her everything.\\n“Tricia,” I said, “back when I was in Ottawa, I was so nervous about\\nmaking out with a girl that I drank six beers.…” I left nothing out; told Tricia\\nthe whole, shameful tale, and I ended by admitting that I was impotent, and\\nalways would be, that it was no use, there was nothing to be done, that my\\ndesire for her could never be matched by anything solid, anything worthy of\\nthe name. But I was desperate for her not to abandon me, too, so if there was\\nanything I could do to keep her, all she had to do was ask and on and on and\\non I went, burbling like a little river in the spring.\\nDear Tricia Fisher—she let me babble on and on, as I tried my best to\\nconvince her that no matter how beautiful she was—and she was very\\nbeautiful indeed—it didn’t matter: I was destined to repeat that night in\\nOttawa for the rest of my days.\\nEventually, I wound down, and took a deep breath. Tricia said very\\ncalmly, very simply, “Come with me. That’s never going to happen again.”\\nWith that, she walked over to me, took my hand, led me back to bed, laid\\nme down, and sure enough … sheer glory, for two whole minutes! That\\nnight, by the dint of a miraculous universe and the ministrations of a beautiful\\nyoung woman who deserved better, I finally first misplaced my virginity thenlost it altogether, and impotence has not been part of my vocabulary since,\\njust as she promised it wouldn’t be. Everything about me—at least physically\\n—works just fine.\\nAnd how, pray tell, did you manage to pay such a debt, Mr. Perry, such\\nan onerous debt to the woman who saved your life in one of the most\\nmeaningful ways imaginable?\\nWhy, good reader, I paid that debt to Tricia by sleeping with almost every\\nwoman in Southern California.\\n(On one such date back then, with another eighteen-year-old, at one point\\nthe woman stopped dinner and said, “Let’s go back to your house and have\\nsex.”\\nSex still being relatively new to me I agreed right away. We went to my\\napartment and as we crossed the threshold, she stopped me and said, “Wait\\nwait wait! I can’t do this! You have to take me home.”\\nWhich of course I did.\\nThe following day, I felt bothered by what had happened, and already in\\ntherapy, I shared the story with my therapist.\\n“I’m going to tell you a story and it’s going to help you,” he said. “When\\na woman comes over to your place, and she takes her shoes off, you are going\\nto get laid. If she leaves them on, you won’t.”\\nI was eighteen then; I am fifty-two now; and he has been right 100\\npercent of the time. There have been times I’ve cheated a little and left a pair\\nof shoes at my doorstep as a kind of hint that this is where the shoes go. But\\nthat therapist’s insight has been correct every single time—if a woman keeps\\nher shoes on, it’s a make-out session at best.)\\nYears later, Tricia and I would date again, while \\nFriends\\n was at its peak.\\nShe didn’t abandon me, but old fears crept up, and I ended the relationship. I\\nonly wish I could truly feel that she didn’t abandon me, truly believe that.\\nMaybe things would be better. Maybe vodka tonic wouldn’t have become my\\ndrink of choice.\\nMaybe everything would be different. Or maybe, not.\\nBut to Tricia, and those after her, I thank you. And to all the women that I\\nleft, simply because I was afraid that they were going to leave me, I deeply\\napologize from the bottom of my heart. If I only knew then, what I knownow.…INTERLUDE\\nMatman\\n“This is the pitch,” I said. “Ya ready?”\\nAdam said, “Sure! Lay it on me!”\\nI took a long drag of my Marlboro, pushed the phone closer to my cheek,\\ngave a long exhale of tar and nicotine and pain, and began selling.\\n“OK,” I said. “It’s about this guy. You’d recognize him. His name is Matt\\nand he’s about fifty years old. And he’s very very famous from doing a super\\nbeloved TV show years ago. But now, when the movie starts, we meet him\\nand he’s got a pot belly—there are piles of empty pizza boxes in his\\napartment, all piled up like that totem in \\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\\nyou know, the one they made out of mashed potatoes … anyway, his life is a\\nlittle bit of a mess. He is lost. Then, out of the blue, a distant relative of his\\ndies and leaves him $2 billion. And he uses the money to become a\\nsuperhero.”\\n“I love it!” says Adam.\\nThen he said, “Did you really inherit two billion dollars?”\\nAdam’s a funny guy.\\n“No, no!” I said. “It’s just the character who inherits the money. \\nDoes any\\nof that spark anything with you? Because if it does, what’s our next move?\\nYou’re the big shoulders.”\\n“I’m not really the big shoulders,” Adam said, though we both know he\\nis. I appreciated his modesty, but modesty won’t get you even a “fuck you” in\\nHollywood.\\n“What do you mean?” I said. “Of course you’re the big shoulders.…”\\nThis was, after all, Adam McKay, the guy who directed \\nAnchorman\\n andStep Brothers\\n and a bunch of other big stuff. At the time we were chatting, he\\nwas making \\nDon’t Look Up,\\n that movie about a giant asteroid heading toward\\nEarth, you know, the one that stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence,\\nTimothée Chalamet, Mark Rylance, Cate Blanchett, Tyler Perry, Jonah Hill,\\neven Ariana Grande \\nand\\n Meryl Streep—amazing cast.\\nI was in \\nDon’t Look Up\\n at one point, too, and even though I was also\\nheading to rehab in Switzerland, I nevertheless went to Boston to shoot my\\nbit. While there, I pitched a line to Adam that he loved and which became the\\nblow to the scene, which is what you’re always hoping for (he ended up not\\nusing the scene—shit happens; no bigs). The point being, Adam McKay and I\\ngot along really well, and here he was, loving my pitch.\\nAt the time I was in pain from the scar tissue from the surgeries, so I\\nneeded pain meds, but I’d get addicted to them, of course, which would only\\ncause more damage to my insides … but feeling a bit better, I was happy\\nrecently when I got a call from Adam. We were just chatting, but in\\nHollywood there’s no such thing as just chatting, so I figured what the hell—\\nwhy is he calling me? And when he never seemed to get to his point, I seized\\nthe moment and I pitched him my idea.\\n“Anyway, Mr. Big Shoulders,” I said, ignoring his false modesty, “what\\ndo you think?”\\nYou know when there’s a pause in a conversation that in hindsight \\nyou\\nwish could have lasted forever so you don’t have to hear the rest of it?\\n“I don’t think you’re talking to the person you think you’re talking to,”\\n“Adam” said.\\n“What? Well, who is this?” I said.\\n“It’s Adam McLean. We met six years ago. I’m a computer salesman.”\\nIf you’ve seen \\nDon’t Look Up,\\n you’ll know that at the end … well, let’s\\njust say that when I realized it was Adam McLean, not Adam McKay, a huge\\nfucking asteroid smacked into my brain.\\nI have history in this kind of shit, too. Years earlier, Bruce Willis won the\\nPeople’s Choice award for Best Actor for \\nThe Sixth Sense\\n and asked me to\\npresent it to him. That night, backstage, I met Haley Joel Osment and M.\\nNight Shyamalan, and spoke to both of them for about ten minutes.\\nSix months later, I was with some friends at the Sunset Marquis Hotel,and who should walk in but M. Night Shyamalan.\\n“Hey, Matthew,” he said, “long time no see! Can I sit down?”\\nCan he sit down? He had just written and directed \\nThe Sixth Sense.\\n He\\nwas the next Steven Spielberg, of course he can sit down! I was a few drinks\\nin and having a good time (this was when alcohol alone still worked for me).\\nEventually my friends filtered out, and it was just M. Night and me,\\nsitting there, kickin’ it. I remember making a mental note that we were not\\ntalking show business at all, just talking about love and loss and girls and LA\\nand all the other stuff people chat about at bars. He seemed to be having a\\nreally good time, too—laughing at all of my dumb jokes—and I began to\\nthink, \\nHey, this guy likes me! He must be just a huge\\n Friends \\nfan or\\nsomething, because he really seems super focused on everything I’m saying.\\nI usually never do this—I’ve been burned by this line of thinking way too\\nmany times—but I began to have wild fantasies about what \\nthis could do for\\nmy career. He told me that there was another bar that had just opened across\\ntown and asked if I wanted to go with him. Did I want to go with him? He\\nwas M. Night Fuckin’ Shyamalan! Of course I wanted to go with him.\\nWe went to the valet, picked up our cars, and I followed him across town\\nto this new place, all the while certain that I was going to be the star of his\\nnext, huge movie—yeah, there was going to be a new, awesome, twisty\\nmovie and the trick ending was going to be me!\\nMy head was doing cartwheels. I can’t explain why—he just seemed like\\nhe loved me, and my work, and I was just drunk enough to think that this was\\ngoing to be a life-changing night. As we took our seats at the new place, I felt\\ncomfortable [read: drunk] enough to say that we should work together\\nsometime. All at once, a strange look came across his face, and I remember\\nimmediately regretting having said it. He excused himself to go to the\\nbathroom, and while he was gone, someone I knew a bit came up to me asked\\nme how my night was going.\\nI said, “Well, I’ve been hanging out with M. Night Shyamalan all night\\nand I’m telling you, the guy loves me.” My buddy was impressed … that is,\\nuntil M. Night returned from the bathroom.\\n“Matty,” my pal said, looking closely at M. Night, “could I have a word\\nin private?”This was weird as fuck, but drink will make almost anything plausible, so\\nI stepped away from my magical evening with M. Night for a moment.\\n“Matty,” my friend whispered, “that is \\nnot\\n M. Night Shyamalan.”\\nThis revelation caused me to attempt to fully focus my vodka-softened\\neyes for a moment, and through the gloom of the dark bar I squinted hard at\\nN. Night Shyamalan.\\nNot.\\nEven.\\nClose.\\nTurns out, “M. Night” was actually just an Indian gentleman who looked\\nthe tiniest bit like M. Night Shyamalan (maybe it was N. Night Shyamalan?),\\nand who was, in reality, the maître d’ at Mr. Chow Beverly Hills, a hip\\nrestaurant in LA that I frequented … and that I no longer frequent, because I\\ntold its maître d’ that we should work together sometime. \\nWhat kind of a\\nnight did he think he was having?\\n I thought.3\\nBaggage\\nI lived in a perpetual state of \\nGroundhog Day.\\n It’s my favorite movie for a\\nreason.\\nEvery evening, I would head to the Formosa Café on Santa Monica\\nBoulevard in West Hollywood with my friends. There were two signs over\\nthe bar: the one under all the headshots read \\nWHERE THE STARS DINE.\\n The other\\nread \\nWINE BY THE GLASS\\n, but we didn’t drink by the glass—we drank by the\\npint and the quart and the gallon … and vodka, not wine.\\n“We” was Hank Azaria, David Pressman, Craig Bierko, and me. We had\\nformed our very own mini–Rat Pack.\\nI’d met Hank first, when I was sixteen. We were at the CBS lot\\nauditioning for a pilot starring Ellen Greene (of \\nLittle Shop of Horrors\\n). We\\nboth got cast, and he played my uncle in the pilot. We got along so well that\\nwhen I left the nest to move out on my own, I moved into a studio apartment\\nin his building. He was already a seriously funny guy, and by the time I met\\nhim he was doing a ton of voiceover work. That gig would eventually lead\\nhim to becoming an incredibly wealthy guy, but back at the start of it, all we\\nwanted was fame. Fame, fame, fame, that’s all we wanted. And girls, and\\nerm, fame. It was all we cared about \\nbecause, at least for me, I figured being\\nfamous would fill the great hole that was endlessly growing inside of me.\\nBut being prefamous, it was a hole I filled with alcohol.\\nI was drinking all the time—I spent my college years drinking at the\\nFormosa—in fact, in drinking I got a 4.0 GPA and was Alkoól Beta Kappa.\\nLove of alcohol had indeed become the helmsman of my life, but I don’t\\nthink I realized just how much it controlled me until one night when I was outwith my girlfriend at the time, Gaby. Gaby would go on to write for \\nVeep\\n and\\na bunch of other stuff and be a friend for life, but that night, she and I and a\\ngroup of friends went to a magic show in Universal City. I remember\\nordering some specialty drink, simmering with alcohol, to sip on while the\\nguy produced rabbits out of hats, or whatever, but eventually the endless lines\\nof silk scarves out of sleeves grew wearisome, and we all headed back to\\nGaby’s apartment to hang out. Gaby didn’t have any alcohol at home, which\\nis, of course, totally fine, but for me at the age of twenty-one, all of a sudden\\nthis creeping feeling came over me for the first time. I felt my blood on fire\\nfor more to drink; I really wanted another drink, and I could think of nothing\\nelse.\\nIt was that night when I first felt the \\nobsession\\n for alcohol. I noticed that\\nno one else seemed even the slightest bit fazed by the lack of drink at Gaby’s\\n—but I had that overpowering pull, like a great magnet and I was just little\\nshards of iron. I was freaked-out by this, especially as it was me and only me\\nwho seemed to be struggling. So, I decided to not go find more to drink that\\nnight … but it left me unable to sleep, uncomfortable, tossing and turning,\\nlost to it. Restless, irritable, and discontented until the sun finally rose.\\nWhat was happening to me? What was wrong with me? Why was I the\\nonly person there who had been dying for another drink? I couldn’t tell\\nanyone this was happening, because even I didn’t understand it. I think for\\nmany years my drinking was a secret to people—well, at least \\nthe extent of it.\\nCertainly back then. I was just a college-age kid wasting the equivalent of his\\ncollege years on booze and women and making my guy friends, and women,\\nlaugh. What was there to admit?\\nBut what no one knew was I was drinking alone—that remained a secret.\\nHow much I drank when I was drinking alone depended entirely on the year.\\nEventually I’d work my way up to that party bottle with the handle—killed\\nthat in two days, by myself. But that night of the magic show, even then I was\\nfreaking out. What’s going on? I’ve never experienced this feeling before in\\nmy life. Why can’t I think of a single fucking solitary thing except a drink? If\\nyou’re at a bar, you just order another drink … but when it’s the middle of\\nthe night, you don’t tend to lie wide awake wishing you had one in your\\nhand. That was new. That was different. That was terrifying. And that was asecret.\\nTen years later, I read the following words in the Big Book of Alcoholics\\nAnonymous: “Drinkers think they are trying to escape, but really they are\\ntrying to overcome a mental disorder they didn’t know they had.”\\nEureka!—someone understands me. But reading that was both wonderful\\nand horrible. It meant I wasn’t alone—there were others who thought like me\\n—but it also meant I was an alcoholic and would have to quit drinking one\\nday at a time, for the rest of my life.\\nHow was I ever going to have fun again?\\nI can’t decide if I actually like people or not.\\nPeople have needs, they lie, cheat, steal, or worse: they want to talk about\\nthemselves. Alcohol was my best friend because it never wanted to talk about\\nitself. It was just always there, the mute dog at my heel, gazing up at me,\\nalways ready to go on a walk. It took away so much of the pain, including the\\nfact that when I was alone, I was lonely, and that when I was with people, I\\nwas lonely, too. It made movies better, songs better, it made \\nme\\n better. It\\nmade me comfortable with where I \\nwas instead of wishing I was somewhere\\n—anywhere—else. It made me content to hang out with the woman in front\\nof me rather than continually wondering if life would be better if I were\\ndating someone else. It took away being an outsider in my own family. It\\nremoved the walls all around me, except one, even if for a while. It allowed\\nme to control my feelings and, in doing so, control my world. Like a friend, it\\nwas there for me. And I was fairly certain I would go crazy without it.\\nAnd I’m right about that, by the way—I would have gone crazy without\\nit.\\nIt made me want to be a completely different person. To give it up\\nseemed impossible. Learning to move forward in life without it was\\ntantamount to asking someone to go about his or her day without breathing.\\nFor that, I will always be grateful to alcohol. It finally beat me into a state of\\nreasonableness.\\nAccording to Malcom Gladwell, if you did anything for ten thousand\\nhours, you could be an expert. This made me an expert in two areas: 1980stennis and drinking. Only one of those subjects is important enough to save a\\nlife.\\nI’ll let you guess which one.\\nBut when I wanted to feel less alone among people, it was Hank Azaria,\\nDavid Pressman, and eventually Craig Bierko I chose.\\nWeirdly, I’d played a character with the surname Azarian on \\nBeverly\\nHills, 90210.\\n Getting a guest spot on episode nineteen of the twenty-two-\\nepisode first season was a big deal. \\nBeverly Hills, 90210\\n hadn’t yet reached\\ncultural phenomenon status by the time I played Roger Azarian, Beverly\\nHills High tennis star and the son of a hard-charging, distant, businessman\\nfather—but the themes in that episode (teen depression, suicide, and learning\\ndisabilities) marked it out as a show that wouldn’t shy away from real shit,\\nhowever privileged its milieu.\\nThe episode, which borrowed its title from T. S. Eliot of all people\\n(“April Is the Cruelest Month”), opens with me hitting the crap out \\nof some\\ntennis balls, showing off my Canadian-ranked form, my big, whipped\\nforehands and aggressive backhand winners, showcasing the fact that I could\\nreally play. I was even using a throwback, Björn Borg–style wooden Donnay\\nracket with the tiny head, which I manage to break in the scene by hitting too\\nhard. Jason Priestley, in the role of Brandon Walsh, noting my thinly veiled\\nrage, proceeds to ask me how many rackets I go through in a week, and in an\\nart-imitating-life moment, I say, “Depends on whose face I see on the ball.”\\nI couldn’t escape stairwells, even when I was playing a fictional character\\non a TV show. By the end of the episode, I’ve shared a screenplay with\\nBrandon, gotten drunk, held a gun to my own face, and ended up in a locked\\npsychiatric ward—only the gun bit was play-acting, the rest was Method.\\nI wasn’t yet twenty-two. For a few years I’d been a guest actor, doing a\\nseries here, a series there, guest starring roles.\\nThe point was, I was working. My first biggish break had come when I\\nwas cast in \\nSecond Chance,\\n though my casting was overshadowed by who\\nwasn’t\\n cast.\\nI still think \\nSecond Chance\\n had a great premise: a forty-year-old guy\\ncalled Charles Russell dies in a hovercraft accident (because that happens \\nall\\nthe time) and goes to see Saint Peter in his office. If the light shines gold onCharles as he stands in judgment, he goes to heaven; if it shines red, he goes\\nto hell—but if it shines blue, as it does in Mr. Russell’s case, he was called a\\nBlue Lighter, meaning, they didn’t know what to do with him. So, Saint Peter\\ndecides to send him back to Earth to meet his fifteen-year-old self and guide\\nhim through a life of better decision-making. That way, by the time he once\\nagain boards a hovercraft at forty, when he dies the second time, because he’s\\nbeen a better person, the light will change from a we-don’t-know-what-to-do-\\nwith-you blue to a we’re-sold, welcome-to-eternity gold. Can you think of a\\nmore perfect premise for a father-son acting team? And my father and \\nI duly\\nauditioned. Then, disaster—I got a green light to be the son of a Blue Lighter,\\nand Dad got no light at all.\\n“They want you. They don’t want me,” Dad said when he heard the news.\\nI guess I threw him a hard-to-read look—after all, I’d gotten a huge part,\\neven if he hadn’t, so I imagine my face combined sorrow for him and glee for\\nme—so much so that he said, “Do I have to \\nrepeat\\n it? They want \\nyou.\\n They\\ndon’t\\n want me.”\\nMy father’s hurt feelings aside, I had just booked my first TV show. I was\\nmaking five grand a week; I was seventeen years old. My ego was off the\\ncharts; I thought I was the shit, just like everyone thought \\nSecond Chance\\nwas. It came in as number 93 of the ninety-three ranked shows that season.\\nFor the final nine episodes after the initial thirteen, the whole Saint Peter /\\nBlue Lighter stuff had been forgotten and the show just followed me and my\\npals in our various adventures. So, it didn’t matter that the show remained\\nninety-third in a list of ninety-three—someone important had liked me\\nenough to build a show around me, which only increased my ego to epic\\nproportions. And might well have set me up for success later.\\nMy father dealt with this news by not attending a single taping except the\\nvery last one. He had his reasons, I suppose.\\nAccordingly, I was able to score various guest roles after that, and two\\nyears later I got another series, this time in a show starring Valerie Bertinelli.\\nThe show, called \\nSydney,\\n followed the exploits of Valerie as a private eye (!),\\nand I played her fast-talking brother—that’s all you’ll ever need to know\\nabout those thirteen episodes (\\nSydney\\n was canceled after one half season).\\nBut despite its failure to ignite audiences, I’ll never forget two things aboutSydney.\\nFirst, Valerie’s lawyer/love interest in the show was played by an actor\\nnamed Craig Bierko—almost immediately after meeting Craig on set, I called\\nHank Azaria and said, “He sounds the way we do!” which was the highest\\npraise I could give someone. But before I could truly \\nget to see how funny\\nCraig was, there was the second thing I should tell you about \\nSydney\\n—during\\nfilming, I fell madly in love with Valerie Bertinelli, who was clearly in a\\ntroubled marriage and truly getting off on two of the funniest guys on the\\nplanet adoring her and heaping their attention on her.\\nValerie Bertinelli—those seven syllables once stirred every part of my soul\\nand other parts.\\nIn the early 1990s, there was no one more attractive than Valerie. Not\\nonly was she stunning and vivacious, but she also had this great, booming,\\nadorable laugh, which Craig and I longed to hear all day long. Now that\\nCraig and I were cast, it was as if Valerie had two new clowns to play with,\\nand we threw ourselves into those roles with abandon. The three of us had a\\nlot of fun.\\nBut for me, being on \\nSydney\\n and playing the fool with Valerie was more\\nthan just fun—it was serious shit. I was having to hide my love for her as we\\nworked (this wouldn’t be the last time this happened), which was desperately\\ndifficult. My crush was crushing; not only was she way out of my league, but\\nshe was also married to one of the most famous rock stars on the planet,\\nEddie Van Halen. Back when we were making \\nSydney,\\n Eddie’s band, Van\\nHalen, were in the middle of a string of four, back-to-back, number one\\nalbums—they were arguably the biggest band on the planet in the late 1980s,\\nearly 1990s, and Eddie was arguably the greatest rock guitarist on the planet\\nat the time, too.\\nAs for me, well, I was always able to get laid because I made women\\nlaugh, but I knew that being funny always came in second to musicians. (In\\nthe world of music, there’s a hierarchy, too—it’s my contention that bass\\nplayers tend to get laid first, because they’re stolid and cool and their fingers\\nmove in gentle yet powerful ways [except for Paul Mc- Cartney; he never gotlaid first]; drummers come next because they’re \\nall power and grit; then\\nguitarists because they get those fancy solos; then, weirdly, the lead singer,\\nbecause even though he’s out there up front, he never quite looks fully sexy\\nwhen he has to throw his head back and reveal his molars to hit a high note.)\\nWhatever the correct order, I knew I was way behind Eddie Van Halen—not\\nonly was he a musician, which means he was able to get laid more easily than\\nsomeone who is funny, but he was also already married to the object of my\\ndesire.\\nIt is important to point out here that my feelings for Valerie were real. I\\nwas completely captivated—I mean, I was obsessed with her and harbored\\nelaborate fantasies about her leaving Eddie Van Halen and living out the rest\\nof her days with me. I was nineteen and lived in a one-bedroom apartment on\\nLaurel Canyon and Burbank (called Club California, mind you). But fantasies\\nand first loves don’t know about real estate, they don’t know about real\\nanything.\\nI didn’t stand a fucking chance. Of course.\\nThat said, there was one night … I was over at Valerie and Eddie’s house,\\njust hanging out and gazing at Valerie, trying to make her laugh. When you\\nmade her laugh, you felt ten feet tall. As the night progressed, it was clear\\nthat Eddie had enjoyed the fruits of the vine a little too hard, one more time,\\nand eventually he just passed out, not ten feet away from us, but still. This\\nwas my chance! If you think I didn’t actually have a chance in hell you’d be\\nwrong, dear reader—Valerie and I had a long, elaborate make-out session. It\\nwas \\nhappening\\n—maybe she felt the same way I did. I told her I had thought\\nabout doing that for a long time, and she had said it right back to me.\\n“Heaven” eventually wrapped up, and I hopped in my black Honda CRX and\\nheaded back to Club California with a hard-on that could have propped up the\\nLeaning Tower of Pisa, and a nineteen-year-old head flooded with dreams of\\na life spent with the object of my affection/obsession.\\nI told Craig Bierko about this the following day, and he passed \\non some\\ndesperately needed advice and reality, though it was advice I wasn’t ready to\\ntake.\\n“Be careful,” he said. \\nHe’s just jealous,\\n I thought as I prepared for the\\nfollowing day of work, but this time with Valerie as my new girlfriend.The following day at work did not go as I expected it would. Valerie\\nmade no mention of what had happened and was behaving—as she should\\nhave been—like this was just a normal day. I quickly got the hint and also\\nplayed the role I was supposed to, but inside I was devastated. Many a tearful\\nnight and spending the bulk of my daytimes sleeping off hangovers in my\\ntiny trailer—not to mention hours and hours of watching Craig’s part get\\nbigger as Valerie’s love interest on the show—all made for a very sad\\ndisillusioned teenager. The show did very badly, and I was so grateful that\\nfour weeks after that fateful night, \\nSydney\\n got canceled, and I didn’t have to\\nsee Valerie anymore.\\nShe, of course, had done nothing wrong, but having to see her every day\\nand pretend I was fine about everything reminded me too much of what I had\\nto do every day with my mother back in Ottawa, Canada.\\nI have spent my life being attracted to unavailable women. It doesn’t take\\na psychology degree to figure out that this had something to do with my\\nrelationship with my mother. My mother captivated every room she entered. I\\nvividly remember being at some fancy ballroom when I was about six years\\nold, and when my mom came in, every head in the room turned. I wanted her\\nto turn and look at me in these moments, but she was working and could not\\n—it took me only thirty-seven years to work that out.\\nEver since then I have been addicted to “the turn.” Once the turn\\nhappened, I could start making a woman laugh and making her want me\\nsexually. Once the sex was done, reality set in, and I realized I didn’t know\\nthese women at all. They were available, so I had no need for them. I had to\\nget back out there and try to make them make the \\nturn. That’s why I slept\\nwith so many women. I was trying to re-create my childhood and win.\\nI knew none of this at the time, of course, and just thought something had\\ngone wrong with them. Surprise surprise, everyone—Canadian actor-boy had\\nsome major mommy issues.\\nBut I was nineteen, and life quickly moved on for everyone. A year later,\\nVan Halen released the aptly titled \\nFor Unlawful Carnal Knowledge,\\n and I\\nwent back to trying to pick up women at the Formosa. And trying to re-create\\n“the turn” as often as humanly possible.\\nSometimes it worked; but every time, I left at 1:40 \\nA.M.\\n to rush to thenearest liquor store so that I could score more vodka and keep drinking deep\\ninto the night. I’d sit there, emptying the bottle (eventually the one with the\\nhandle), watching \\nThe Goodbye Girl\\n or even the Michael Keaton movie\\nClean and Sober\\n (figure \\nthat\\n one out), until just like Eddie Van Halen, I\\npassed out. A needling thought had begun to enter my brain, too—not a huge\\none, but one nonetheless: \\nYou are drinking every night,\\n though this thought\\nwas quickly washed away by the next drink.\\nAnd every next day, I’d manage to drag myself to lunch, where I would\\nmeet Craig Bierko, to this day, by far the fastest comic mind I have ever seen.\\nI thought my mind was fast, but no, it was Craig Bierko. Hank Azaria became\\nthe richest one of the group, because he had been doing a voice on \\nThe\\nSimpsons\\n since 1955. I was to be the most famous, and David Pressman was\\nto be a journeyman actor just like his dad, Laurence Pressman, and the\\ncraziest. David loved to do things like run naked into a supermarket shouting,\\n“I have horrible problems, someone please shave me!” and then run out. (He\\ndid this well into his forties; I sometimes joined him in disrobing in public,\\nthough I quit in my mid-thirties because I’m the mature one.)\\nTo this day no one has made me laugh as hard as Craig Bierko. Being\\nfunnier than Hank, David, and me as a threesome was pretty \\nmuch\\nimpossible, but Craig managed it. Being funnier than Hank and me without\\nDavid was also unheard of, but Craig managed that, too. We would go out to\\nlunch, and Craig would say something that was so funny that fifteen minutes\\nafter lunch had finished and I was driving home, I would have to pull over to\\nthe side of the road because I would still be laughing, and Craig would drive\\nby, see me laughing, and know why. There was no one funnier than Craig.\\nNo one.\\nThe other thing that drove our friendships, besides trying to be the\\nquickest, the funniest, was fame—we were all absolutely desperate to be\\nfamous. Hank, being the voice of \\nThe Simpsons,\\n had the most lucrative gig,\\nbut it was not the Al Pacino career he longed for. As for me, well, I had done\\nplenty of TV, but nothing that had even remotely brought me fame … and\\nfame, fame, fame, that’s all that any of us cared about. In between the\\nlaughter—and after we’d shared the latest stories of auditions gone awry or\\nscripts we’d read and hated—the quieter moments were filled with aprofound worry, a quiet yearning and fear that we would never make it, that\\nfame would just somehow pass us by. We were four strong egos, four funny\\nmen, the bon mots flying about like shrapnel, but the battle raged on: the\\nbattle for \\nfame.\\nI held firm in my belief that fame would fill that unaccompanied hole in\\nme, the one that Valerie refused to fill. But now it was just me and vodka\\nattempting and failing this seemingly impossible task. When fame finally\\nhappened, well … we’re coming to that.\\nI once made out with David Pressman, or tried to, though I didn’t mean to,\\neither way.\\nWhen we were in our early twenties, he and I and a couple of other guys\\nheaded east to Vegas to do the Vegas thing. We basically had no money, but\\nthat had never before stopped four idiots heading to Sin City. I think I had\\nabout two hundred bucks in my pocket; the four of \\nus rented one motel room\\noff the Strip, with two beds. I shared a bed with David; in the middle of the\\nnight, I guess I was dreaming about Gaby, my ex, and was inching closer and\\ncloser to David, saying things like “Aw, baby,” and “You smell so good,”\\nand “I promise I’ll be quick.” He, too, was mercifully asleep, but his\\nsubconscious had the wherewithal to keep saying, “NO!” and “back up!” and\\n“leave me the fuck alone!” Eventually I started kissing the back of his neck,\\nwhich caused us both to startle awake—seeing the horrified look on his face I\\nsaid, “Aw, just forget it,” and scuttled back to my side of the bed.\\nClearly, we all needed some release.\\nThe first night we hit the tables, and somehow, I lucked into something,\\nwinning $2,600 at blackjack, which was the most cash any of us had ever\\nhad.\\nIt was time to spend it unwisely.\\nI lifted up my arms and, like a king, exclaimed, “I’m getting everyone\\nlaid!”\\nA cabdriver took us way out of town to a place called Dominions, a place\\nhe promised us would satiate our needs (he received, presumably, a cut for\\nevery set of foolish young men he deposited at Dominions in the desert). Toeven gain ingress to this fine establishment, we were informed by a man with\\nno neck that somebody had to drop at least a grand, and as I’d done well on\\nthe tables, that privilege fell to me. In fact, I ended up plopping down $1,600\\non a single bottle of champagne, at which point we were each escorted to a\\nseparate, boxy room, where a young lady awaited each of us.\\nI figured the $1,600 I’d already spent would be good for what I hoped\\nwould come next, but I was sadly mistaken. In fact, I wasn’t going to be\\ntaken at all unless I proffered another $300, which I duly did, but before I\\ncould graduate to the business end of the evening, David Pressman and the\\nother two guys appeared at my door, needing their own $300 stipend. Their\\nfinancial needs met, I returned to the \\nmatter at hand. (It didn’t occur to me to\\ndo the math, but here it is in case you need it: I started with $200, won\\n$2,600, dropped $1,600 on the champagne, and ponied up an additional $300\\neach, for a total of $2,800—everything I had.)\\nWith the financial commitments in place, the young lady proceeded to\\nstart dancing at me, a ways off at the other side of the room, and though she\\ngyrated in a perfectly acceptable, if slightly “Roxbury Girls” manner, I was\\nready to take our relationship to the next level.\\n“What the hell is going on?” I said, obliquely.\\n“What?” she said.\\n“What? We’re supposed to be having sex!” I said. “I’ve spent a small\\nfortune in here!”\\nThen she explained to me for some reason that I could arrange the pillows\\nwherever I wanted to.\\n“That’s wonderful, and I’m excited about the pillow thing—I really am—\\nbut aren’t we supposed to be doing something else right about now?” I\\nasked/begged.\\n“Are you the police?” she asked.\\n“No!” I said, though I was beginning to wonder if I should call them to\\nreport a fraud. “I paid you all that money. We had a deal—”\\n“Oh!” she said, interrupting me. “That was just for the dance.…”\\nAt that point, a rapping on the door alerted me to the fact that each of my\\ncronies had faced the same, disappointing fate. But as we were thoroughly\\nout of money by this point, with tears in our eyes, four taken (though \\nnottaken) losers stepped out into the inky black of the Mojave and began the\\nlong walk back to the motel.\\nOne of my friends, Nick, did get to take his girl to \\nYoung Guns II\\n the\\nfollowing day, so that’s something. And there were a lot of unanswered\\nquestions in the original \\nYoung Guns.\\nIn 1994, Craig Bierko was the hot item in that particular pilot season. All of\\nus were running around auditioning for the latest slate of sitcoms and dramas,\\nbut Craig was the one everyone wanted. This, and he was quicker with a line\\nthan me. He was also much better-looking than me, but let’s not go into any\\nmore of that—we don’t want a crying author on our hands. I should have\\nhated him, but funny always wins, so I decided to keep loving him.\\nI was twenty-four, and already I was missing 50 percent of my auditions.\\nI was tailing out as an actor. Drinking was slowly but surely winning the war\\nagainst auditions, and no one was really interested in me anyway. I wasn’t\\ngetting any movies, and the roles I got on TV were hardly setting the world\\nalight. I was hungover half the time, the rest of the time I was on my way to\\nlunch or the Formosa. My manager sat me down one day and told me that the\\npeople I aspired to be—Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks—all possessed the\\nattitude I was shooting for. But they both also looked great, and he was\\ngetting daily feedback from casting directors and producers that I looked like\\na mess.\\nHank, too, was starting to get worried that he was wasting his life away\\nand stopped coming to the Formosa and the funny lunches—he was always\\nvery serious about his body and his career.\\nI shouldn’t have been surprised, but around that time, I got a phone call\\nfrom my then–business manager.\\n“Matthew, you are out of money.”\\n“How about a little warning?” I said, scared to death. “Did it occur to you\\nthat a few months ago you could have given me a heads-up? You know, via a\\ncall in which you said, ‘Hey, \\nMatthew,\\n your funds are looking a bit \\nanemic,\\n’\\ninstead of waiting till I was now broke?”\\nThere was silence on the other end of the line, as though keeping tabs onsomeone’s income \\nbefore\\n they were broke was an entirely new concept for a\\nbusiness manager.\\nFortunately, I had just enough juice in me to book a part in a terrible \\npilot.\\nHanging up with my now former business manager, I called my agents and\\ntold them I was out of money, I needed a job, something, anything, and it had\\nto be right then.\\nIf, gentle reader, you’re imagining that’s how I got \\nFriends,\\n you might\\nwant to cool your jets. That call led to the show that almost \\nstopped\\n me from\\ngetting \\nFriends.\\nL.A.X. 2194\\n was a “sci-fi comedy” about baggage handlers at Los Angeles\\nInternational Airport. You could really stop there, but there’s more: those\\nnumbers in the title give away the twist—it was set two hundred years in the\\nfuture, and the air travelers would be aliens. The show would star Ryan Stiles\\nas an automaton office manager with a weird accent (seriously, Ryan is a\\nhilarious actor, but what was that accent?), and me as the poor guy who had\\nto be the lead in this mess and sort out the baggage issues for the arriving\\naliens, who happen to have been played by Little People in ridiculous wigs.\\nIf all this sounds underwhelming, please know that it was way worse than\\nthat. I had to wear a futuristic shirt for a start. Despite my misgivings (to\\nrepeat, it was a “comedy” about baggage handlers set two hundred years in\\nthe future where the aliens are played by Little People), the pilot paid me\\n$22,500, so I was set for drinks and food at the Formosa for a while … but it\\ndid something else, too: because I was attached to \\nL.A.X. 2194,\\n I was thereby\\noff the market for all other shows.\\nThen, disaster struck, and I don’t mean \\nL.A.X. 2194\\n got picked up for a\\nseason—that never happened, thank God. What did happen was a script for a\\nnew show called \\nFriends Like Us\\n became the hot read of the season.\\nEveryone who read it knew it was going to be great; I read it and immediately\\ncalled those same agents who’d gotten me \\nL.A.X. 2194.\\n“You have to get me on \\nFriends Like Us,\\n” I said.\\n“Not gonna happen,” my agents said. “You’re attached to the baggage\\nhandlers show. They’ve already measured you for the futuristic shirt andeverything.”\\nI was devastated. When I read the script for \\nFriends Like Us\\n it was as if\\nsomeone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my\\nmannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life. One\\ncharacter in particular stood out to me: it wasn’t that I thought I could \\nplay\\n“Chandler,” I \\nwas\\n Chandler.\\nBut I was also Blaine in \\nL.A.X. 2194. Fuck me, is everyone kidding? Am I\\nthe least lucky person on the planet?\\nIt only got worse. Because \\nFriends Like Us\\n was the hot ticket of the\\nseason, everyone was reading it, everyone was auditioning for it, and\\neveryone, it seemed, decided that the part of Chandler was exactly like me\\nand came to my apartment to ask me to help them with their auditions. A few\\neven went a long way, based on my choices and my choices alone. Hank\\nAzaria thought it was so good he auditioned for it twice, for the role of Joey.\\nThat’s right—he auditioned for it, got passed on, begged and pleaded to go in\\nagain, and got passed on again. (Later, Hank would be Phoebe’s romantic\\ninterest for a few episodes, performances for which he won an Emmy. I did\\n237 episodes and won nothing.)\\nI ended up knowing the script for \\nFriends Like Us\\n pretty much off by\\nheart because I’d practiced it so much with my pals—in fact, there were times\\nI just acted Chandler out for them and told them to copy what I’d done, so\\nsure was I that it was the right way to play him. And still I would call my\\nagents every three or four days begging for a chance.\\nNow, we are forgetting about Craig Bierko, the hottest ticket in town.\\nOne morning, Craig called Hank and me to breakfast, and as we walked in\\nwe saw Craig sitting at a table with two scripts open in front of him.\\n“Guys,” Craig said, “I’ve been offered two shows—Jim Burrows, the\\nhottest director in Hollywood, is directing both. One is called \\nBest Friends,\\nand the other is that one called…”\\nWait, don’t say it, please don’t say it …\\n“… \\nFriends Like Us\\n.”\\nHe had been offered the role of Chandler. It made my head explode.\\n“And I need you to tell me which one to take.”\\nMy first instinct was to tell him to take his jobs and go fuck himself. Buthe was a close friend, so Hank and I both obliged. The three of us read those\\ntwo scripts that morning, though I already knew \\nFriends Like Us\\n off by heart,\\nand it was clear which one he should take. My heart sank, because I knew I\\nwas Chandler, but I also wasn’t an asshole. I was crushed. We both told Craig\\nto do \\nFriends Like Us.\\n(This made me think of an exchange from my episode on \\nBeverly Hills,\\n90210\\n:\\nBRANDON:\\n \\nWhat about friends?\\nROGER:\\n \\nFriends? My father says those are the only ones you can’t trust.\\nBRANDON:\\n \\nDo you always listen to him?\\nROGER:\\n \\nNo.\\n)\\nLunch was winding down and it was time for Craig to tell his agents\\nwhere his head was at. Hank made his goodbyes and went to the gym,\\nbecause he was always going to the gym, and I went with Craig as he looked\\nfor a pay phone. (No cell phones folks; this was 1994.) The nearest one was\\noutside a Fred Segal store (the same store that weirdly also features in my\\nepisode of \\nBeverly Hills, 90210\\n). Craig threw a few coins in the machine,\\ntapped in the numbers, and waited. Eventually they patched him through.\\nAnd then, I stood two feet away from Craig and listened to him pick THE\\nOTHER SHOW! I couldn’t believe my fucking ears. So, the new lead of \\nBest\\nFriends\\n and I parted ways. I raced home to make another plea to get an\\naudition for \\nFriends Like Us.\\nA few weeks later I went to the taping of the pilot for \\nBest Friends\\n—it\\nwas funny; Craig was funny, and the lead, which is what he really wanted.\\nPerfectly fine, cute show. But the final role available during the entire pilot\\nseason of 1994, Chandler in \\nFriends Like Us,\\n was still not cast. And I was\\nstill attached to the fucking futuristic baggage handler show!\\nYou know how sometimes the universe has plans for you that are hard to\\nbelieve, how the world wants something for you even though you’ve done\\nyour best to close off that avenue?Welcome to my 1994.\\nNBC producer Jamie Tarses—oh, sweet, magical, much-missed Jamie\\nTarses—who was helping to develop \\nFriends Like Us,\\n at NBC—apparently\\nturned to her then-husband, Dan McDermott, a Fox TV producer, one night\\nin bed.\\n“Hey, is the show \\nL.A.X. 2194\\n going to get picked up?” Jamie reportedly\\nsaid.\\nDan said, “No, it’s \\nawful\\n—for a start, it’s about baggage handlers in the\\nyear 2194. They wear futuristic vests.…”\\n“So, is Matthew Perry available? A safe second position?” Jamie said.\\n(That’s Hollywood-speak for “available.”) (Ironically, Jamie and I dated for\\nseveral years much later, after she got divorced.)\\nA couple of days later I got the phone call that would change my life.\\n“You’re meeting Marta Kauffman about \\nFriends Like Us\\n tomorrow.”\\nAnd this is no lie: I knew right then and there just how huge it was all\\ngoing to be.\\nMarta Kauffman, along with David Crane, was the person most\\nresponsible for what would become \\nFriends\\n. Next day, a Wednesday, I read\\nas Chandler for her, and I broke all the rules—for a start, I didn’t carry any\\npages of the script (you’re supposed to carry the script with you when you\\nread, because that way, you’re acknowledging to the \\nwriters that it’s just a\\nwork in progress). But I knew the script so well by this point. Of course, I\\nnailed it. Thursday, I read for the production company, and nailed it, and\\nFriday I read for the network. Nailed it again. I read the words in an\\nunexpected fashion, hitting emphases that no one else had hit. I was back in\\nOttawa with the Murrays; I got laughs where no one else had.\\nI was cheering up my mother.\\nAnd Chandler was born. This was my part now and there was no stopping\\nit.\\nThe pilot season of 1994 had cast its final actor: Matthew Perry as\\nChandler Bing.\\nThat phone call at Fred Segal’s, and Craig’s desire to be the star of his ownshow, rather than be part of an ensemble, saved my life. I don’t know what\\nwould have happened to me had the call gone the other way. It is not out of\\nthe realms of possibility that I may have ended up on the streets of downtown\\nLA shooting heroin in my arm until my untimely death.\\nI would have loved heroin—it was my opiate addiction on steroids. I’ve\\noften said that taking OxyContin is like replacing your blood with warm\\nhoney. But with heroin, I would imagine, you \\nare\\n the honey. I loved the\\nfeeling of opiates, but something about the word “heroin” always scared me.\\nAnd it is because of that fear that I am still alive today. There are two kinds\\nof drug addicts, the ones who want to go up, and the ones who want to go\\ndown. I could never understand the coke guys—why would anyone want to\\nfeel more present, \\nmore\\n busy? I was a downer guy, I wanted to melt into my\\ncouch and feel wonderful while watching movies over and over again. I was\\na quiet addict, not the bull-in-a-china-shop kind.\\nSure, without \\nFriends,\\n I may have had a career as a sitcom writer—I’d\\nalready written a pilot called \\nMaxwell’s House,\\n but though I had some skills,\\nit hadn’t sold. But there was no way I could have been a journeyman actor. I\\nwouldn’t have stayed sober for that; it was not worth not doing heroin for\\nthat. \\nFriends\\n was such a good and fun job that it curtailed everything for a\\nwhile at least. I was the second baseman for the New York Yankees. I\\ncouldn’t fuck that up. I would never forgive myself.…\\nWhen you’re earning $1 million a week, you can’t afford to have the\\nseventeenth drink.\\nAbout three weeks before my audition for \\nFriends,\\n I was alone in my\\napartment on Sunset and Doheny, tenth floor—it was very small, but it had a\\ngreat view, of course—and I was reading in the newspaper about Charlie\\nSheen. It said that Sheen was yet again in trouble for something, but I\\nremember thinking, \\nWhy does he care—he’s famous?\\nOut of nowhere, I found myself getting to my knees, closing my eyes\\ntightly, and praying. I had never done this before.\\n“God, you can do whatever you want to me. Just please make me\\nfamous.”Three weeks later, I got cast in \\nFriends\\n. And God has certainly kept his\\nside of the bargain—but the Almighty, being the Almighty, had not forgotten\\nthe first part of that prayer as well.\\nNow, all these years later, I’m certain that I got famous so I would not\\nwaste my entire life trying to get famous. You have to get famous to know\\nthat it’s not the answer. And nobody who is not famous will ever truly\\nbelieve that.INTERLUDE\\nDead\\nI bought her a ring because I was desperate that she would leave me. I didn’t\\nwant to be this injured and alone during Covid.\\nI was high on 1,800 milligrams of hydrocodone when I asked her to\\nmarry me.\\nI had even asked for her family’s blessing. Then I’d proposed, high as a\\nkite. And on one knee. And she knew it, too. And she said yes.\\nI was in Switzerland at the time, at yet another rehab. This one was at a\\nvilla on Lake Geneva with its own butler and chef, the kind of luxurious\\nplace where you were guaranteed to not meet anybody else. (Thereby pretty\\nmuch defeating the purpose of every rehab I had ever heard of.) But what it\\nlacked in fellow sufferers it made up for in the easy availability of drugs,\\nwhich again, unfortunately, did not differentiate it from other high-priced\\nrehabs. I could make millions if I sued these places, but it would divert more\\nattention to the situation, which I didn’t want to do.\\nI did my usual trick, complaining about intense stomach pain, when in\\nfact I was OK (it still felt like I was constantly doing a sit-up—so it was very\\nuncomfortable—but it wasn’t Pain). So, they’d give me hydrocodone—as\\nmuch as I could actually feel—which turned out to be 1,800 milligrams a\\nday. To put that in perspective, if you broke your \\nthumb, and had a kind\\ndoctor, he or she would probably prescribe you five 0.5-milligram pills.\\nNot enough to put a dent in this guy.\\nI was also doing ketamine infusions every day. Ketamine was a very\\npopular street drug in the 1980s. There is a synthetic form of it now, and it’s\\nused for two reasons: to ease pain and help with depression. Has my namewritten all over it—they might as well have called it “Matty.” Ketamine felt\\nlike a giant exhale. They’d bring me into a room, sit me down, put\\nheadphones on me so I could listen to music, blindfold me, and put an IV in.\\nThat was the hard part—I’m always a little dehydrated because I don’t drink\\nenough water (big surprise), so finding a vein was no fun. I was like a\\nfucking pincushion by the end of it. Into the IV went a smidge of Ativan—\\nwhich I could actually feel—and then I was on a ketamine drip for an hour.\\nAs I lay there in the pitch-dark, listening to Bon Iver, I would disassociate,\\nsee things—I’d been in therapy for so long that I wasn’t even freaked-out by\\nthis. Oh, there’s a horse over there? Fine—might as well be.… As the music\\nplayed and the K ran through me, it all became about the ego, and the death\\nof the ego. And I often thought that I was dying during that hour. \\nOh,\\n I\\nthought, \\nthis is what happens when you die.\\n Yet I would continually sign up\\nfor this shit because it was something different, and anything different is\\ngood. (Which just so happens to be one of the last lines of \\nGroundhog Day.\\n)\\nTaking K is like being hit in the head with a giant happy shovel. But the\\nhangover was rough and outweighed the shovel. Ketamine was not for me.\\nBack in my room, the butler had laid out more clothes I wouldn’t change\\ninto, the chef had prepared yet another healthy meal I wouldn’t touch, and I\\nwent back to looking at Lake Geneva a lot, completely fucking high. But not\\nthe good kind of high. A loopy drunk feeling that I did not enjoy.\\nI was also now, somehow, engaged.\\nAt some point, the rehab geniuses decided that to help my stomach\\n“pain,” they’d put some kind of weird medical device in my back, but they’d\\nneed to do surgery to insert it. So I stayed up all night, taking 1,800\\nmilligrams of hydrocodone ahead of the next day’s surgery. In the operating\\nroom they gave me propofol, you know, the drug that killed Michael Jackson.\\nI learned then and there that Michael Jackson didn’t want to be high, he\\nwanted to be out. Zero consciousness. And yet another masterful talent taken\\nfrom us by this terrible disease.\\nI was given the shot at 11:00 \\nA.M.\\n I woke up eleven hours later in a\\ndifferent hospital.\\nApparently, the propofol had stopped my heart. For five minutes. It\\nwasn’t a heart attack—I didn’t flatline—but nothing had been beating.If I may be so bold, please pause your reading of this book for five\\nminutes—look at your phone, starting now:\\n[Insert five minutes of you time]\\nThat’s a long fucking time, right?\\nI was told that some beefy Swiss guy really didn’t want the guy from\\nFriends\\n dying on his table and did CPR on me for the full five minutes,\\nbeating and pounding my chest. If I hadn’t been on \\nFriends,\\n would he have\\nstopped at three minutes? Did \\nFriends\\n save my life again?\\nHe may have saved my life, but he also broke eight of my ribs. As I lay\\nthere in agony, the following day the head doctor waltzed in, all full of\\nhimself and said, “You will get no ketamine here, and if you need to go to a\\nrehab, there is one we can send you to.”\\n“I’m already in a fucking rehab!” I screamed, and in a rare show of\\nphysical anger, I knocked over the table next to me, which was covered in\\nmedical supplies. This scared the doctor, and he promptly left the room. I\\napologized for the mess I had made and got the hell out of there.\\n(The rehab I was speaking of had already done a rapid detox, but \\nthey put\\nme under for the wrong two days—the first two [it should have been days\\nthree and four]. By the time I came around, the detox fully hit, and I’d gone\\nfrom 1,800 milligrams to bupkis. Not much a butler and a chef can do about\\nthat.)\\nThose eight broken ribs were, by the way, much the same injury that the\\nNew Orleans Saints’ quarterback Drew Brees suffered in a game in\\nNovember 2021 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brees would break three\\nmore the following week and puncture his lung—just to be better than me—\\nbut then he missed four games, so I’d argue we’re at least even. Which makes\\nme feel tough.\\nRight in the middle of all this madness (but prior to the rib thing) I took a\\nmeeting with Adam McKay about a big movie called \\nDon’t Look Up.\\n There\\nwas no Chandler, that day—I wasn’t on. I couldn’t get it up for that. We justtalked for a while, and as I walked out, I said, very calmly, “Well, I’d love to\\nhelp you in any way I can with this thing.”\\nAdam said, “I think you just did.”\\nI got the call the following day that he was hiring me—this would be the\\nbiggest movie I’d gotten ever. It promised to be a little calm within the storm.\\nI was to play a Republican journalist and was supposed to have three scenes\\nwith Meryl Streep. Yes, that’s right. I got to do a group scene (with Jonah\\nHill among others) in Boston where the movie was filmed—I was on 1,800\\nmilligrams of hydrocodone then, too, but nobody noticed. But with the\\nbroken ribs, there was no way I could continue, so I never got to do my\\nscenes with Meryl. It was heartbreaking, but I was in too much pain. God\\nknows how Brees continued to throw a football, but you don’t get to do a\\nscene with Meryl Streep with broken ribs. And I couldn’t smile without it\\nhurting like fuck.\\nBeing in \\nDon’t Look Up\\n didn’t work out because my life was on fire, but\\nI learned an important lesson: I was hirable in something \\nbig without putting\\non a show. In that meeting, Adam and I had just been two men talking. I will\\ntreasure that moment, that day, that man. What a good guy. And I sincerely\\nhope our paths cross again (I’ll be sure to check it’s actually him next time).\\nWhen it came time to leave Switzerland, I was still on 1,800 milligrams\\nof Oxy every single fucking day. I was told that once back in Los Angeles I’d\\nstill be able to get that much—and I needed it, just to stay level. As ever, this\\nwas not me getting high; this was purely maintenance, so I didn’t go through\\nagonies. I flew back on a private jet—there was no way I could fly\\ncommercial, given that everyone in the world recognized my damn face—and\\nit cost me a cool $175,000 to do so. Back in LA, I went to see my doctor.\\n“I need eighteen hundred milligrams a day,” I said. No point beating\\naround the bush.\\n“Oh no,” she said, “we’re not giving you that at all—cancer patients only\\nget a hundred milligrams.” This only upped my gratitude that I didn’t have\\ncancer.\\n“But the doctor in Switzerland told me that’s what I’d be on when I got\\nhome.”\\n“Oh, they’ll consult,” she said, “but I’m in charge now. Here’s thirtymilligrams.”\\nThis would not do. I would get incredibly sick.\\nThere was only one thing for it: that very same night, I booked another\\n$175,000 private jet and flew right back to Switzerland.\\n“I need you to combine my morning and evening dose.”\\n“\\nIch verstehe kein Englisch,\\n” the Swiss nurse said.\\nThis was going to be a problem. My pressing need to change the rules,\\nversus her lack of English. This was all done in some weird German-English\\ngame of charades.\\nI don’t need a pill at six o’clock in the morning. I need it when it’s scary\\nat night. I can’t find the center of the fear—it’s general. Also, I can’t sleep, so\\nthere’s a negotiation every single night with myself. My mind races. The\\nideas come so fast. I get auditory hallucinations, too—I hear voices and\\nconversations and sometimes, I even talk back. Sometimes, too, I’ll think that\\nsomebody wants to hand me something, and I put my hand out to get that\\nnothing from no one. Sober or not, this troubled me a bit. On top of\\neverything else, I was crazy? It’s not schizophrenia, just a damn load of\\nvoices. The voices, I’m told, do not make me a crazy person. They are called\\nauditory hallucinations and they happen to people all the time.\\nThere is no cure for the voices. Of course there isn’t. Actually, I can think\\nof a cure, it’s called, “being somebody else.”\\nEither way, I needed those pills as one shot, at night, without saving any\\nfor the morning.\\n“Morning. Evening. Together,” I said, miming eight pills in my hand, not\\none.\\n“\\nNee, keine Ahnung,\\n” she said.\\n“Tomorrow morning. No pill. Now instead,” I said, extremely slowly.\\n“Ich habe keine Ahnung, was Sie brauchen.”\\nYou and everyone else—no one knows what I need.Back in LA one more time, trying to sober up, I think, \\nWait … how did I get\\nengaged? There are dogs living in my house. How did this happen?\\nI had asked her parents, begged for her hand while high, and put up with\\nthe dogs. That’s how scared I was of being abandoned.4\\nLike I’ve Been There Before\\nIt was so special it felt like we’d all been together in a previous life or\\nsomething. Or in a future life, but certainly this one. This was a real day. But\\na day that dreams were made of.\\nFor the longest time I didn’t really want to talk too much about \\nFriends.\\nPartly that was because I’d done plenty of other stuff, too, but all anyone ever\\nwanted to talk about was Chandler—it’s like James Taylor talking about\\n“Fire and Rain” (a gruesome little tale if you’ve ever heard what that’s\\nabout). It’s like a band who’ve written a brilliant new album but all anyone\\nwants to hear when they play live is the hits. I always admired Kurt Cobain’s\\nrefusal to play “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” or Led Zeppelin’s refusal to play\\n“Stairway to Heaven.” \\nThe New York Times\\n once said that “\\nFriends\\n … sticks\\nto [Perry] like a sweaty shirt.” They weren’t right about that—in fact, that’s\\njust fucking cruel—but they weren’t the only ones to think it. I was so good\\nat something, yet I was being penalized for it. I left my blood, sweat, and\\ntears onstage every Friday night—we all did. And that should be a good\\nthing, not something that says we can only excel at \\nthat.\\nI’m not complaining. If you are going to be typecast, that’s the way to do\\nit.\\nBut in recent years, I’ve come to understand just what \\nFriends\\n means to\\npeople. And we knew from the very start that it was something very, very\\nspecial.\\nI was the last actor to be cast in the entire pilot season of 1994—in fact, I gotthe gig on the actual final day of pilot season.\\nWith \\nL.A.X. 2194\\n thankfully in the rearview mirror, I was free to be\\nChandler Bing. The following Monday after the Friday I was hired was day\\none of my new life—this was big, and I guess we all felt that way, because\\nwe all showed up dead on time. Well, Matt LeBlanc was first, every single\\nday; Aniston last, every single day. The cars got nicer, but the order stayed\\nthe same.\\nWe sat around the table, and all met each other for the first time. That is,\\nexcept me and Jennifer Aniston.\\nJennifer and I had met through mutual acquaintances about three years\\nearlier. I was immediately taken by her (how could I not be?) and liked her,\\nand I got the sense she was intrigued, too—maybe it was going to \\nbe\\nsomething. Back then I got two jobs in one day—one was \\nHaywire,\\n an\\nAmerica’s Funniest Home Videos\\n–type show, and the other was a sitcom. So\\nI called Jennifer and I said, “You’re the first person I wanted to tell this to!”\\nBad idea—I could feel ice forming through the phone. Looking back, it\\nwas clear that this made her think I liked her too much, or in the wrong kind\\nof way … and I only compounded the error by then asking her out. She\\ndeclined (which made it very difficult to actually go out with her), but said\\nthat she’d love to be friends with me, and I compounded the compound by\\nblurting, “We can’t be \\nfriends\\n!”\\nNow, a few years later, ironically we \\nwere\\n friends. Fortunately, even\\nthough I was still attracted to her and thought she was so great, that first day\\nwe were able to sail right past the past and focus on the fact that we had both\\ngotten the best job Hollywood had to offer.\\nEveryone else was brand-new to me.\\nCourteney Cox was wearing a yellow dress and was cripplingly beautiful.\\nI had heard about Lisa Kudrow from a mutual friend, and she was just as\\ngorgeous and hilarious and incredibly smart as my friend had said. Mattie\\nLeBlanc was nice and a cool customer, and David Schwimmer had had his\\nhair cut really short (he had been playing Pontius Pilate for his theater troupe\\nin Chicago) over his hangdog face and was incredibly funny right away;\\nwarm and smart and creative. After me, he was the guy who pitched the most\\njokes—I probably pitched ten jokes a day and two of them got in. Theyweren’t just jokes for me; I’d pitch jokes for everybody. I’d go up to Lisa and\\nsay, “You know, it might be funny if you tried to say this…” and she’d try it.\\nThe director, Jimmy Burrows, was the best in the business, too—he’d\\ndirected both \\nTaxi\\n and \\nCheers\\n. He knew instinctually that Job One for us was\\nto get to know each other and generate chemistry.\\nImmediately, there was electricity in the air.\\nI’d always wanted to be the only funny one. But now, at the ripe old age\\nof twenty-four, I quickly realized that it’s better if everyone is funny. I could\\nalready tell that this was going to be big; I knew it from the start, but I didn’t\\nsay anything out loud. Partly that was because it isn’t unheard of for an actor\\nto fuck up a table read so badly that they were politely asked to leave before a\\nminute of shooting took place. But that would be tomorrow—for now, Jimmy\\ntook the six of us to Monica’s apartment set and told us just to talk to each\\nother. And so we did—we talked and joked, about romance, our careers, our\\nloves, our losses. And the bond that Jimmy knew would be critical had\\nbegun.\\nThe six of us ate lunch together, outside on a beautiful spring day. As we\\nate, Courteney—the only established name of the group back then—said,\\n“There are no stars here. This is an ensemble show. We’re all supposed to be\\nfriends.”\\nGiven her status—she’d been on \\nFamily Ties\\n and in \\nAce Ventura\\n and in a\\nguest spot on \\nSeinfeld\\n and had danced with Bruce Springsteen in the video\\nfor “Dancing in the Dark”—she could have been everything and everybody;\\nshe could easily have said “I’m the star.” Hell, she could have had her lunch\\nsomewhere else, and we would have to have been fine with it. Instead, she\\nsimply said, “Let’s really work and get to know each other.” She said it’s\\nwhat she’d noticed about how it worked on \\nSeinfeld,\\n and she wanted it to be\\ntrue about \\nFriends,\\n too.\\nSo we did what she suggested. From that first morning we were\\ninseparable. We ate every meal together, played poker.… At the start, I was\\nfull-on the joke man, cracking gags like a comedy machine whenever I could\\n(probably to the annoyance of everyone), trying to get everybody to like me\\nbecause of how funny I was.\\nBecause, why else would anybody like me? It would take fifteen years forme to learn that I didn’t need to be a joke machine.\\nThat first afternoon we were assigned dressing rooms, which eventually\\ndidn’t matter because we were never in them. We were always together. As\\nwe all walked to our cars and said goodbye that first evening, I remember\\nthinking, \\nI’m happy.\\nThis was not an emotion I was altogether used to.\\nThat night I called my friends (except for Craig Bierko, given what had\\nhappened) and told them what a wonderful day I’d had. I then spent yet\\nanother night “at college” (the Formosa), as was my custom. I remember\\nsaying that night that I was on a show that was so good it was better than\\nanything I could have dreamed of writing myself.… My friends were all so\\nhappy for me, but even then, I could sense a shift.\\nMaybe I was growing out of this Formosa thing? I had a life-changing job\\nthat I had to—hell, desperately \\nwanted\\n to—report to in the morning, so I\\ndrank far less than usual. My apartment even had \\na Lifecycle in the back, and\\nI used it every day, dropping about ten pounds of baby/alcohol fat between\\nthe pilot and the first episode.\\nThat night I went to bed thinking, \\nI can’t wait to get back there\\ntomorrow.\\n Next morning, as I drove from Sunset and Doheny over the\\nCahuenga Pass to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, I realized that I was\\nleaning toward the windshield as I drove. I wanted to be there.\\nThat would be true for the next decade.\\nDay two was big. We reported to a new building—Building 40—for our first\\ntable read. I was nervous and excited, and yet confident, too. I had always\\nbeen good at table reads. But there was still the looming thought that anyone\\ncould be fired and replaced (Lisa Kudrow, for example, had originally been\\ncast as Roz on \\nFrasier\\n but had been fired during the rehearsal process by\\nnone other than … \\nFriends\\n director, Jimmy Burrows). If jokes didn’t land, or\\nsomething was off, well, anybody could be replaced before they’d evenproperly found their way to their dressing room.\\nBut I \\nknew\\n Chandler. I could shake hands with Chandler. I \\nwas\\n him.\\n(And I looked a hell of a lot like him, too.)\\nThat day, the room was packed—in fact, it was standing room only.\\nThere were writers, executives, network people. There must have been a\\nhundred people in the room, but I was a song-and-dance man, and this is\\nwhere I excelled. We got reacquainted with Marta Kauffman, David Crane,\\nand Kevin Bright—the people behind the show, and who had hired us—and\\nalmost instantly we all felt they were our parental figures.\\nBefore the table read began, we all went around the room introducing\\nourselves and saying what we did for the show. Then it was time to read.\\nHow would it go? Would the chemistry we’d only just started to \\ncreate show\\nup, or were we just six young hopefuls making believe that this would be our\\nbig break?\\nWe needn’t have worried—we were ready, the universe was ready. We\\nwere pros—the lines flew out of our mouths. No one made a mistake. All the\\njokes landed. We finished to thunderous applause.\\nEveryone could smell money.\\nThe cast could smell fame.\\nAfter the read the six of us piled into a van and were brought to the actual\\nset at stage 24 to begin rehearsing. But it was the run-through at the end of\\nthe day that sealed the deal—the jokes, the chemistry, the script, the\\ndirection, everything was magical. All the elements seemed to meld into one\\nhilarious, cogent, powerful whole. And we all knew it.\\nThis show was going to work, and it was going to change everyone’s\\nlives forever. I swear there was a popping sound; if you listened really\\nclosely, you could hear it. It was the sound of people’s dreams coming true.\\nIt was everything I thought I wanted. I was going to fill all the holes with\\nFriends Like Us.\\n Fuck Charlie Sheen. I was going to be so famous that all the\\npain I carried with me would melt like frost in sunlight; and any new threats\\nwould bounce off me as though this show was a force field I could cloak\\nmyself in.There is an unwritten law in show business that to be funny, you had to either\\nlook\\n funny, or be older. But here we were, six attractive people, all in their\\ntwenties, all knocking every joke out of the park.\\nThat evening, I drove home on a cloud. There was no traffic; all the lights\\nwere green; a trip that should have taken half an hour took fifteen minutes.\\nThe attention that I always felt had eluded me was about to fill every corner\\nof my life, like a room illuminated by a \\nflash of lightning. People were going\\nto like me now. I was going to be enough. I mattered. I wasn’t too needy. I\\nwas a star.\\nNothing was going to stop us now. No one walking into a ballroom would\\nhave to turn around and notice me. All eyes would be on me now, not the\\npretty woman walking three feet in front of me.\\nWe rehearsed the rest of the week, and it was then that we began to notice\\nsomething else. I have been an actor since 1985 and that has never happened\\nbefore or since, and it was beautiful: the bosses were not in the least\\ntyrannical. In fact, it was a truly creative atmosphere. We could pitch jokes,\\nand the best joke won, no matter where it came from. The craft services lady\\nsaid something funny? Put it in, it didn’t matter. So, not only was I there as\\nan actor, but my creative juices were flowing, too.\\nThe creators took each of us out for lunch, too, to get to know us, so they\\ncould incorporate some aspects of our real personalities into the show. At my\\nlunch I said two things: one, that even though I considered myself not\\nunattractive, I had terrible luck with women and that my relationships tended\\ntoward the disastrous; and two, that I was not comfortable in any silence at all\\n—I have to break any such moment with a joke. And this became a built-in\\nexcuse for Chandler Bing to be funny—perfect for a sitcom—and Chandler\\nwasn’t much good with women, either (as he shouts at Janice as she leaves\\nhis apartment, “I’ve scared ya; I’ve said too much; I’m awkward and\\nhopeless and desperate for love!”).\\nBut think of a better character for a sitcom: someone who is\\nuncomfortable in silence and has to break the silence with a joke.\\nThis was all too true, both for Chandler, and for me. Fairly early in the\\nmaking of \\nFriends\\n I realized that I was still crushing badly on Jennifer\\nAniston. Our hellos and goodbyes became awkward. And then I’d askmyself, \\nHow long can I look at her? Is three seconds too long?\\nBut that shadow disappeared in the hot glow of the show. (That, and her\\ndeafening lack of interest.)\\nOn tape nights, nobody made a mistake. We might have run scenes over\\nif a joke didn’t land—all the writers would huddle together and rewrite—but\\nmistakes? Just never happened. So many shows have blooper reels, but there\\nare only a few for \\nFriends.\\n From the pilot on … in fact, that pilot was error-\\nfree. We were the New York Yankees: slick, professional, top of our game\\nfrom the very start. We were ready.\\nAnd I was talking in a way that no one had talked in sitcoms before,\\nhitting odd emphases, picking a word in a sentence you might not imagine\\nwas the beat, utilizing the Murray-Perry Cadence. I didn’t know it yet, but\\nmy way of speaking would filter into the culture across the next few decades\\n—for now, though, I was just trying to find interesting ways into lines that\\nwere already funny, but that I thought I could truly make dance. (Marta\\nKauffman was later to say that the writers would underline the word not\\nusually emphasized in a sentence just to see what I would do with it.)\\nEven when there were issues with the characters, we were able to work\\nthem out to the point where the solutions created their own iconic moments.\\nWhen I first read the script, I knew it was different because it was so\\ncharacter driven and smart. But early on, Matt LeBlanc was concerned that\\nbecause he was this kinda cool, macho, ladies’ man in the script, Rachel,\\nMonica, and Phoebe wouldn’t be friends with him, wouldn’t like him that\\nmuch, and that made his character less believable.\\nIt didn’t help that Matt was very good-looking—he had leading man\\nlooks, even to the point where I was a little jealous of that when I first saw\\nhim. But he was so nice and funny that any jealousy I had soon disappeared\\n—but still, he hadn’t been able to find the right way into his character. He\\nwas the one character in the show that had not been properly defined—he\\nwas described as a cool, Pacino-type, out-of-work \\nactor, so that’s how he was\\nplaying it, but it still wasn’t working. At one point during a wardrobe session,\\nhe put on brown leather pants, which were thankfully nixed by everyone,\\nespecially Marta, who was in charge.\\nThen came the moment early in the run where he has an exchange withCourteney about a woman he’s been seeing and how the sex wasn’t working\\nout. Courteney asks him if he’s thought of being there for the girl, and Joey\\njust simply doesn’t understand the concept. That was the moment he turned\\nfrom being a ladies’ man to a loveable, useless, dumb puppy. He underlined\\nthis by doing a running joke of things being repeated to him and him not\\nfollowing them. He had found his position in the show, which was basically\\nas a big dumb brother to Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe. Everyone was in\\nplace.\\nOccasionally Matt would come into my dressing room, mostly during\\nseason one, and ask me how to say his lines. And I would tell him, and he\\nwould go downstairs, and he would nail it … but he gets Most Improved\\nPlayer because by season ten, I was going into his room and asking \\nhim\\n how\\nhe would say certain of \\nmy\\n lines.\\nThis was all to come. For now, we were filming shows ahead of our fall\\n1994 air date. And as yet, no one knew who we were.\\nWith the shows in the can, all that was left to find out was our time slot. NBC\\nknew they had something special, so they put us right between \\nMad About\\nYou\\n and \\nSeinfeld.\\n It was the perfect spot; plum. This was before streaming, so\\nyour time slot was crucial. It was still the days of appointment TV, when\\nfolks would rush home to catch the 8:00 \\nP.M.\\n show or the 9:00 \\nP.M.\\n show. And\\npeople organized their lives around their shows, not the other way round. So,\\n8:30 \\nP.M.\\n on a Thursday, between two huge shows, was a massive deal.\\nWe flew to New York on the Warner Bros. jet for the “upfronts.” The\\nupfronts are when a show is presented to the affiliates. It was on this trip that\\nthey told us the name of the show was now \\nFriends\\n (when they renamed it I\\nthought it was a horrible idea—I never said I was a smart person), and\\nFriends\\n was a smash with the affiliates, too—everything was lining up. In\\nNew York we were celebrating, getting drunk, partying; then on to Chicago\\nfor more upfronts, more partying.\\nThen we had to wait a summer before the show first aired. I filled that\\nsummer with three notable things—gambling in Vegas at the behest of\\nJimmy Burrows; a trip to Mexico on my own; and a make-out session in acloset with Gwyneth Paltrow.\\nI was back in Williamstown, Massachusetts, when I met Gwyneth. She\\nwas doing a play there, and I was visiting my grandfather. At some big party\\nwe slipped off into a broom cupboard and made out. We were both still\\nunknown enough that it didn’t make it to the tabloids, but with that in mind, it\\nfell to Jimmy Burrows to give me a reality check.\\nAfter the upfronts it was clear the show was going to be a hit, so Jimmy\\nflew us all to Vegas on the jet—we watched the pilot of \\nFriends\\n on the way\\n—and once we arrived, he gave us each $100 and told us to go gamble it and\\nhave fun, because once the show aired in the fall, we’d never be able to do it\\nagain.\\n“Your lives are going to utterly change,” Jimmy said, “so do some things\\nin public now because once you’re as famous as you’re about to be, you’ll\\nnever be able to do them again.” And that’s what we did; we six new friends\\ngot drunk and gambled and wandered through the casinos, just six close\\nstrangers on a weekend trip, unknown to anyone, no one asking for\\nautographs or photos, none of us being chased by paparazzi, a million miles\\nfrom what was coming, which was every single moment of our lives being\\ndocumented in public for all to see forever.\\nI still wanted fame, but already I could taste a wild and weird flavor in the\\nair—would fame, that elusive lover, really fill all the holes I carried around\\nwith me? What would it be like to not be able to put \\ntwenty on black in some\\nharsh-lit casino, a vodka tonic in my hand, without someone shouting,\\n“Matthew Perry just put twenty on black, everyone, come and see!” This was\\nthe last summer of my life when I could make out at a party with a beautiful\\nyoung woman called Gwyneth and no one, save Gwyneth and I, cared.\\nWould the payoff be worth it? Would giving up a “normal” life be worth\\nthe price paid, of people digging through my trash, clicking pictures through\\ntelephoto lenses of me at my worst, or best, or everything in between?\\nWould I ever again be able to anonymously replicate my twenty-first\\nbirthday, when at the Sofitel across from the Beverly Center, I’d drunk seven\\n7 and 7s, poured a bottle of wine into a huge brandy snifter—you know, the\\none they put on the piano for tips—ordered a cab, gotten into the back of the\\ncab with the snifter, still sipping the wine, tried to give directions to my homewhen I could only pronounce the letter \\nL,\\n only for the guy up front to yell,\\n“What the fuck are you doing?” because he wasn’t a cabdriver—it was just\\nsome random car?\\nMost important, would these holes get filled? Would I want to trade\\nplaces with David Pressman or Craig Bierko, or they with me? What would I\\ntell them down the line when my name became a shorthand for stand-up\\ncomedians and late-night hosts, a shorthand that meant “addict”? What would\\nI tell them when complete strangers hated me, loved me, and everything in\\nbetween?\\nWhat would I \\ntell\\n them?\\nAnd what would I tell God when he reminded me of my prayer, the one\\nI’d whispered three weeks before I got \\nFriends\\n.\\nGod, you can do whatever you want to me. Just please make me famous.\\nHe was about to keep one half of the bargain—but this also meant he\\ncould do whatever he wanted with me as the other half. I was com\\npletely at\\nthe mercy of a God who was sometimes merciful, and sometimes thought it\\nwas perfectly fine to put his own son on a fucking cross.\\nWhich way would he choose for me? Which one would Saint Peter pick?\\nThe gold, the red, or the blue?\\nI guess I was about to find out.\\nWith Jimmy Burrows’s words about impending fame still ringing in my ears,\\nI figured I should take one last trip as an anonymous person.\\nLate in the summer of 1994 I flew alone to Mexico. I’d recently broken\\nup with my girlfriend, Gaby, and decided to go on a booze cruise, solo. In\\nCabo, I wandered about, getting drunk and calling girls in LA from my room.\\nThen, each night on the cruise, I’d head to some kind of weird party where\\neverybody was all nervous until they brought out a jug of booze, then it was\\non. I was lonely; I didn’t get laid; it was hot in Cabo but cold inside me. I\\ncould feel God watching me, waiting. The most unnerving part was, I knew\\nGod was omniscient, which meant that he knew, already, what he had in store\\nfor me.Friends\\n premiered on Thursday, September 22, 1994. It initially hit number\\n17 in the rankings, which was really good for a brand-new show. The reviews\\nwere mostly stellar, too:\\n“Friends” … promises to be … offbeat and seductive.… The cast is\\nappealing, the dialogue is pitch-perfect 1994.… “Friends” comes as\\nclose as a new series can get to having everything.\\n—The New York Times\\n“Friends” has so many good moves that there’s really nothing to\\ndislike. It’s all so light and frothy that after each episode you may be\\nhard-pressed to recall precisely what went on, except that you laughed\\na lot.\\n—Los Angeles Times\\nA game cast delivers the barrage of banter with an arch coyness that\\nsuggests they think they’re in some Gen X Neil Simon play.\\n—People\\nIf fans of “Mad About You” and “Seinfeld” can handle the age\\ndifference, they should feel right at home with the six as they sit\\naround riffing on life, love, relationships, jobs and each other.\\n—The Baltimore Sun\\nA couple of reviews hated it:\\nOne character says he dreamed he had a telephone for a penis and\\nwhen it rang, “it turns out it’s my mother.” And this is in the first five\\nminutes. [It’s a] ghastly creation … so bad.… The stars include that\\ncute Courteney Cox, formerly funny David Schwimmer, Lisa\\nKudrow, Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry. They all look nice, and\\nit’s sad to see them degrading themselves.\\n—The Washington PostAnemic and unworthy of its Thursday-night time slot.\\n—Hartford Courant\\nBut then, Dick Rowe, an A&R man from Decca, in turning down the\\nBeatles, told Brian Epstein in 1961 that “guitar groups are on their \\nway out.”\\nI wonder how those reviewers feel now, having dissed arguably the most\\nbeloved show of all time. They really missed the boat on that one. Had they\\nalso hated \\nSeinfeld\\n? \\nM*A*S*H\\n? \\nCheers\\n? \\nSt. Elsewhere\\n?\\nWe were not on our way out. We were the very definition of prime time,\\nwhen prime time still mattered. The gold rush of television. Even more\\nimportant than the great reviews, we’d dropped only about 20 percent of the\\naudience for \\nMad About You,\\n which was an incredibly strong performance\\nfor a new show. By episode six, we were beating \\nMad About You,\\n which\\nmeant we were a smash hit. Pretty soon we hit the top ten, then the top five,\\nand we wouldn’t leave the top five for a decade. This is unheard of, still.\\nSo here it was—\\nfame.\\n Just as we’d predicted, \\nFriends\\n was huge, and I\\ncouldn’t jeopardize that. I loved my co-actors, I loved the scripts, I loved\\neverything about the show … but I was also struggling with my addictions,\\nwhich only added to my sense of shame. I had a secret, and no one could\\nknow. And even making the shows could be painful. As I admitted at the\\nreunion in 2020, “I felt like I was gonna die if [the live audience] didn’t\\nlaugh. And it’s not healthy for sure. But I would sometimes say a line, and\\nthey wouldn’t laugh, and I would sweat and—and just, like, go into\\nconvulsions. If I didn’t get the laugh I was supposed to get, I would freak out.\\nI felt like that every single night.”\\nThis pressure left me in a bad place; and I also knew that of the six people\\nmaking that show, only one of them was sick. The fame I’d yearned for had\\narrived, though—in London it was as if we \\nwere\\n the Beatles, with people\\noutside our hotel rooms screaming—and the show ended up covering the\\nglobe.\\nIn late October 1995—between the airing of episodes five and six of\\nseason two—I flew to New York to notch my first appearance on the \\nLate\\nShow,\\n when going on Letterman was the pinnacle of pop culture \\nfame. I was\\nin a dark suit—at one point, Letterman would finger my lapel and describe itas “late 1960s, British Invasion, kinda mod.”\\n“Ladies and gentlemen, this man is on the number one show in America,\\nplease welcome Matthew Perry.”\\nI sauntered out a star. I had made it. But I was so nervous I could barely\\nstand, which was why I was quite happy to be sitting.\\nI shook hands with Mr. Letterman and dove into my well-rehearsed\\nroutine, a long description of a typical \\nGilligan’s Island\\n episode. I somehow\\nswung it so that I’d told the same story to Yasser Arafat, who was staying in\\nmy hotel (it was during the fiftieth anniversary of the UN, and everyone was\\nin town). This was just the kind of bizarre, wordy story Letterman loved. The\\nlaughs landed—I even got Dave to crack a few times—and my earth-\\nshattering fear had been properly hidden.\\nEverything was good. Everything was golden. I had just turned twenty-\\nfive. I was in the biggest sitcom on the planet; I was in a hotel in New York,\\nwatching as world leaders were hustled into elevators by flanks of security,\\nputting on a thousand-dollar suit ahead of joshing it up with Dave Letterman.\\nThis was fame. And just beyond the glare of the city, beyond the\\nskyscrapers and the faint stars twinkling beyond the midtown skies, God\\nlooked down on me, just waiting it out. He’s got all the time in the world.\\nFuck, he invented time.\\nHe wouldn’t forget. Something was looming. I had an idea what it was,\\nbut I did not know for sure. Something to do with drinking every night … but\\njust how bad was it going to be?\\nThe juggernaut was just getting going, though. The show was a cultural\\ntouchstone; we were getting mobbed everywhere we went (David\\nSchwimmer would later tell the story that he was accosted by a gaggle of\\nyoung women on the street who physically pushed his girlfriend out of the\\nway to get near him). By late 1995, right around the time of the Letterman\\nappearance, I also had a new, and very famous, girlfriend of \\nmy own. But\\nbefore we get there, I had some unfinished business with the “other”\\nChandler.\\nI didn’t hear from Craig Bierko for two years after I got Chandler—he hadmoved to New York, and we lost touch.\\nBest Friends,\\n the show he chose over \\nFriends Like Us,\\n had gone nowhere.\\n(Later, Warren Littlefield, former network president of NBC, wrote in his\\nmemoir about Craig not choosing \\nFriends,\\n “Thank God! There was\\nsomething Snidely Whiplash about Craig Bierko. He seemed to have a lot of\\nanger underneath. The attractive leading man who you love and can do\\ncomedy is very rare.”) He was working steadily—he’d eventually star in \\nThe\\nMusic Man\\n on Broadway and \\nThe Long Kiss Goodnight\\n with Geena Davis\\nand Sam Jackson, among a lot of other really awesome stuff—but the\\ndivergence of our fortunes had left our friendship in flames.\\nI missed him. He was still the quickest comedic mind I’d ever met, and I\\nloved that—and much else—about him. I could no longer go to the Formosa\\nto just hang out, either; I missed that life, too. I’d taken to drinking alone in\\nmy apartment because that was safest. The illness was deepening, but I\\ncouldn’t see it, not then. And if anyone saw how much I was drinking, they\\nmight be alarmed and ask me to stop. And stopping was, of course,\\nimpossible.\\nOne day, though, Craig Bierko called me out of the blue. He wanted to\\ncome by and see me. I was delighted, but apprehensive. You know that\\nfeeling when you end up dating someone your best friend had a crush on? It\\nfelt like that; I’d taken the role he could and should have taken, and\\neverything had gone gold for me, then platinum, then some other rare metal\\nas yet undiscovered.\\nI had no idea how a meeting with my former friend would go. Marta\\nKauffman would later comment, “We saw a countless number of actors \\n[for\\nChandler], but things happened as they were supposed to happen.” But I\\ncouldn’t say anything like that to Craig, because the thing that was supposed\\nto happen—the miracle—had happened to me, not to him. (That had been his\\nchoice, not mine.)\\nWhen he got to my apartment, the tension was high. Craig spoke first.\\n“I want you to know that I am very sorry for not speaking to you for two\\nyears,” he said. “I simply could not handle that you got rich and famous\\ndoing a role that I turned down. We were both good enough to get that role,\\nand yeah, so, I just could not handle it.…”I heard him out; there was a silence. The traffic on Sunset was backing up\\nall the way to the Fred Segal on La Cienega.\\nI decided I wouldn’t mention Fred Segal.\\nI hated what I was \\nactually\\n about to say, but I had to say it.\\nI said: “You know what, Craig? It doesn’t do what we all thought it\\nwould. It doesn’t fix anything.” (What a sobering thought for a twenty-six-\\nyear-old who had only ever wanted fame and had only just realized that fame\\nhadn’t filled the holes at all. No, what had filled the holes was vodka.)\\nCraig stared at me; I don’t think he believed me; I \\nstill\\n don’t think he\\nbelieves me. I think you actually have to have all of your dreams come true to\\nrealize they are the wrong dreams.\\nLater, when I was promoting \\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip,\\n I told \\nThe\\nGuardian,\\n “I’ve been on the least-watched show in the history of television\\n[\\nSecond Chance,\\n in 1987] and the most-watched [\\nFriends\\n] and none of it\\nreally did what I thought it was going to do to my life.”\\nGiven everything, there is no way I wouldn’t change places with Craig,\\nand David Pressman, and the guy in the gas station down the block—I’d\\nchange places with all of them in a minute, and forever, if only I could not be\\nwho I am, the way I am, bound on this wheel of fire. They don’t have a brain\\nthat wants them dead. They slept fine at \\nnight. I don’t expect that would\\nmake them feel any better about the choices they made, the way their lives\\nwent.\\nI would give it all up not to feel this way. I think about it all the time; it’s\\nno idle thought—it’s a coldhearted fact. That Faustian prayer I made was a\\nstupid one, the prayer of a child. It was not based on anything real.\\nBut it became real.\\nI have the money, the recognizability, and the near-death experiences to\\nprove it.INTERLUDE\\nZoom\\nFinally, back in LA, from Switzerland. It was Covid time. Everything\\neverywhere was shut down. We’d all closed ourselves off in little rooms,\\nterrified of death. My head was clearing up, though, and I was once again in a\\nbattle for sobriety.\\nThe pandemic was slightly easier for me to handle for two reasons. (1) It\\nwas happening outside of my head. And (2), it gave me a pretty damn good\\nexcuse for hiding out in my 10,400-square-foot apartment on the entire\\nfortieth floor of the Century Building in Century City.\\nMy ribs had started to feel a bit better at least and I was sobering up. That\\nmeant that I was slowly beginning to realize that I was engaged, lived with a\\nwoman and two dogs. Needless to say, I was not ready for any of this. You\\nlive with me? We live together? We have kids’ names picked out, the whole\\nnine yards, which is the name of a movie I once made?\\nYou went down on one knee to propose, which really hurt your stomach,\\nremember?\\nI didn’t remember—needless to say, we broke up.5\\nNo Fourth Wall\\nYou know how during Covid some people felt like they were living the same\\nday over and over and over again?\\nHere’s the day I wish I could live over and over again (this is the\\nGroundhog Day of my Groundhog Day). In fact, I wish I could relive it every\\nday for the rest of my life. But I cannot. So, the only way to get past it is to\\ntell it like a story, see if that helps.\\n(This of course will not bring it back.)\\nIt was New Year’s Eve 1995, Taos, New Mexico. All afternoon we’d\\nbeen playing football in the snow. Me, and my girlfriend, Julia Roberts, and a\\nbunch of our friends. She was the biggest movie star in the world, and I was\\non the number one show on TV.\\nThe courtship had initially been conducted via fax. Somewhere in the\\nworld, there is a stack of faxes about two feet long—a two-foot-long\\ncourtship, filled with poems and flights of fancy and two huge stars falling\\nfor each other and connecting in a beautiful, romantic way.\\nAt the time, I was walking on air. I was the center of it all and nothing\\ncould touch me. The white-hot flame of fame was mine—I kept passing my\\nhand through it, but it didn’t burn yet; it was the inert \\ncenter. I had not\\nlearned yet that fame would not fill the hole, but at the time it filled it just\\nnicely, thank you very much.\\nSeason one of \\nFriends\\n had been a smash hit, and I had basically floated\\ninto season two. I’d done Letterman; I was slated to do Leno. We’d hit the\\ncover of \\nPeople\\n magazine and \\nRolling Stone\\n magazine when both were a big\\ndeal. Now, the movie offers were coming in. Why would they not? I wasgetting anything I wanted. Million-dollar movie offer here, million-dollar\\nmovie offer there. I was no Julia Roberts, but there was only one of those.\\nThen something that only happens to famous people happened. Marta\\nKauffman approached me and said that I should probably send flowers to\\nJulia Roberts.\\nYou mean the biggest-star-in-the-universe Julia Roberts?\\n“Sure, great, why?” I said.\\nTurned out Julia had been offered the post–Super Bowl episode in season\\ntwo and she would only do the show if she could be in my story line. Let me\\nsay that again—she would only do the show if she could be in \\nmy\\n story line.\\n(Was I having a good year or what?) But first, I had to woo her.\\nI thought long and hard about what to say on the card. I wanted it to\\nsound professional, star to star. (Well, star to much bigger star.) But I wanted\\nsomething a tad flirty in there, too, to match what she had said. I’m still\\nproud of what I settled on. I sent her three dozen red roses and the card read:\\nThe only thing more exciting than the prospect of you doing the show\\nis that I finally have an excuse to send you flowers.\\nNot bad right? I was afraid to go to sleep at night, but I could pour on the\\ncharm when called for. But my work here was far from done. Her reply was\\nthat if I adequately explained quantum physics to her, \\nshe’d agree to be on\\nthe show. Wow. First of all, I’m in an exchange with the woman \\nfor whom\\nlipstick was invented,\\n and now I have to hit the books.\\nThe following day, I sent her a paper all about wave-particle duality and\\nthe uncertainty principle and entanglement, and only some of it was\\nmetaphorical. Alexa Junge, a staff writer on the show, told \\nThe Hollywood\\nReporter\\n many years later that “[Julia] was interested in [Matthew] from afar\\nbecause he’s so charming. There was a lot of flirting over faxing. She was\\ngiving him these questionnaires like, ‘Why should I go out with you?’ And\\neveryone in the writers’ room helped him explain to her why. He could do\\npretty well without us, but there was no question we were on Team Matthew\\nand trying to make it happen for him.”\\nIn the end, all our efforts worked. Not only did Julia agree to do the show,\\nbut she also sent me a gift: bagels—lots and lots of bagels. Sure, why not? Itwas Julia fucking Roberts.\\nThus began a three-month-long courtship by daily faxes. This was pre-\\ninternet, pre–cell phones—all our exchanges were done by fax. And there\\nwere many; hundreds. At first, it was the edges of romance: I sent her poems,\\nasked her to name the triple crown line on the Los Angeles Kings, that kind\\nof thing. And it wasn’t like we weren’t both busy—I was shooting the most\\npopular show on the planet, and she was shooting a Woody Allen movie,\\nEveryone Says I Love You,\\n in France. (Of course she was.) But three or four\\ntimes a day I would sit by my fax machine and watch the piece of paper\\nslowly revealing her next missive. I was so excited that some nights I would\\nfind myself out at some party sharing a flirtatious exchange with an attractive\\nwoman and cut the conversation short so I could race home and see if a new\\nfax had arrived. Nine times out of ten, one had. They were so smart—the way\\nshe strung sentences together, the way she saw the world, the way she\\narticulated her unique thoughts, all was so captivating. It wasn’t uncommon\\nfor me to read these faxes three, four, sometimes five times, \\ngrinning at that\\npaper like some kind of moron. It was like she was placed on this planet to\\nmake the world smile, and now, in particular, me. I was grinning like some\\nfifteen-year-old on his first date.\\nAnd we had never even spoken yet, much less met each other.\\nThen early one morning, something changed. Julia’s fax veered romantic.\\nI called a friend and said, “I’m in over my head. You have to come over right\\naway. Tell me if I’m wrong.”\\nWhen he arrived, I showed him the fax and he said, “Yup, you are not\\nwrong. You are most certainly in over your head.”\\n“What am I supposed to send back?”\\n“Well, how do you \\nfeel?\\n”\\n“Oh, fuck off,” I said, “just tell me what to say.”\\nSo, “Cyrano” and I compiled and sent a fax that veered romantic, too.\\nThen we stood there, by the fax machine, looking at each other. Two men just\\nstaring at a machine.\\nAfter about ten minutes, the jarring sound of the fax machine—all bongs\\nand whirrs and hissing messages from outer space—filled my apartment.\\n“Call me,” it said, and her phone number was at the bottom.I picked up the phone and called Julia Roberts. I was nervous as hell, as\\nnervous as my first appearance on Letterman. But the conversation went easy\\n—I made her laugh, and man, what a \\nlaugh.…\\n She was clearly extremely\\nsmart, a big intellect. I could tell already that she was easily in the top three\\nof storytellers that I had ever met, too. Her stories were so good, in fact, that\\nat one point I asked her if she had written them out ahead of time.\\nFive and half hours later, as we came to a close, I realized I wasn’t\\nnervous anymore. After that we could not be stopped—five-hour\\nconversations here, four-hour conversations there. We were falling; I wasn’t\\nsure into what, but we were falling.\\nIt was clear that we were in deep smit.\\nOne Thursday, my phone rang again.\\n“I’ll be at your house at two \\nP.M.\\n, Saturday.”\\nClick.\\nAnd there we had it.\\nHow did she even know where I lived? What if she didn’t like me? What\\nif the faxes and the phone calls were all really cute but when it came to real\\nlife, she didn’t want me anymore?\\nWhy can’t I stop \\ndrinking\\n?\\nSure enough, at 2:00 \\nP.M.\\n that Saturday, there was a knock on my door.\\nDeep breaths, Matty.\\n When I opened it, there she was, there was a smiling\\nJulia Roberts on the other side.\\nI believe I said something like:\\n“Oh, \\nthat\\n Julia Roberts.”\\nEven in moments like this, the jokes just flew by. Craig would have said\\nit faster, but he wasn’t there. She laughed that Julia Roberts laugh, the one\\nthat could launch a thousand ships. And any tension seemed to just vaporize.\\nShe asked me how I was doing.\\n“I’m feeling like the luckiest man in the word. How are \\nyou\\n doing?”\\n“You should probably invite me in now.”\\nI did let her in, both figuratively and literally, and a relationship began.\\nWe would already be a couple by the time we started filming the \\nFriends\\nSuper Bowl episode.\\nBut before we filmed it, it was New Year’s Eve, in Taos. It was about tobe 1996. I was dating Julia Roberts. I’d even met her family. She picked me\\nup in her orange Volkswagen Beetle, after flying me there privately. I\\nthought I had money\\n. She\\n had money.\\nWe’d played football in the snow all day. Later, Julia looked at me,\\nlooked at her watch—11:45 \\nP.M.\\n—took my hand, and said, “Come with me.”\\nWe jumped in this big blue truck and drove up a mountain, snow \\nswirling\\naround. I had no idea where we were going. We seemed to be heading up into\\nthe very stars themselves. Eventually, we reached a mountaintop, and for a\\nmoment the weather cleared, and we could see New Mexico and beyond, all\\nthe way back to Canada. As we sat there, she made me feel like the king of\\nthe world. A gentle snow was falling, and with that, 1996 began.\\nIn February, Julia went on Letterman\\n,\\n and he pressed her on whether or\\nnot we were dating. She had just guest starred in the \\nFriends\\n episode “The\\nOne After the Super Bowl.” That episode—replete as it was with guest stars\\nlike Julia, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Brooke Shields, and Chris Isaak, among\\nothers—was viewed by 52.9 million people, the most watched show ever to\\nfollow a Super Bowl. The ad revenue alone was staggering—more than half a\\nmillion dollars for thirty seconds of airtime. The show was now solidly\\nNBC’s major cash cow.\\n(And yet, I can still recall a couple of nights thinking, \\nI wish I was on\\n ER\\ninstead of\\n Friends. I could never get enough attention. The problem was still\\nthere, my fingerprint, the color of my eyes.)\\nWe’d filmed Julia’s part of the double episode a few days after New\\nYear’s—January 6 to 8. They’d written lines for me like, “Back then, I used\\nhumor as a defense mechanism—thank God I don’t do that anymore,” and\\n“I’ve met the perfect woman.” Our kiss on the couch was so real people\\nthought it \\nwas\\n real.\\nIt was. She was wonderful on the show, and our chemistry seemed to seep\\noff televisions all across America.\\nTo answer Letterman\\n,\\n Julia yet again proved her smarts by fucking with\\neveryone:\\n“Yes, I’ve been going out with Matthew Perry, and for some reason,\\nmaybe because I did the Super Bowl show, people think it is the Matthew\\nPerry from \\nFriends.\\n But, in fact, it’s this haberdasher I met in Hoboken. ButMatthew Perry from \\nFriends\\n is nice, too, so I don’t mind that mistake.”\\nShe also called me “awfully clever and funny and handsome.”\\nEverything back then was a yes.\\nOnce we’d wrapped season two, in April I headed to Vegas to shoot my first\\nmajor movie. I was being paid a million dollars to star in \\nFools Rush In,\\n with\\nSalma Hayek. To this day, it’s probably my best movie.\\nIf I were doing that movie now, I would travel with three people, mostly\\nbecause I am scared to be alone. But back then, it was just me. I wasn’t filled\\nwith fear the way I would be now. I think that’s why they send young people\\noff to war. They are \\nyoung\\n—they aren’t scared; they are invincible.\\nDon’t get me wrong, I was nervous about making \\nFools Rush In.\\n There I\\nwas, in Vegas, with a $30 million movie on my shoulders. On the first day, I\\nwas being driven home and said to the driver, “You have to pull over.” He\\ndid, and I threw up from fear, right there by the side of the road.\\nOn a movie, not only is the work done slower, but it also only works if\\nyou really are actually feeling what you’re trying to portray as a feeling. This\\ndeeper work can be hard to transition to, and I found it more difficult,\\nbecause on movies you tend to shoot scenes out of order.\\nI remember on day two of \\nFools Rush In\\n we were shooting a scene at the\\nobstetrician’s office, hearing our baby’s heartbeat for the first time. I had no\\nidea how to get the feeling for it, given that I’d just met Salma. Later, I\\nremember there was a scene that called for me to cry. I was very scared about\\nthat, too. I thought about it all day long and worried about it all night. I ended\\nup by pulling it off, somehow. The trick is easy—you think of something that\\nmakes you feel really sad. But the timing is difficult, because you have to do\\nit at exactly the right time, and you have to do it over and over again.\\nThat day, I had been crying all day on the set of \\nFools Rush In.\\n I \\nwent up\\nto Andy Tennant, the director, and said, “We’ve been doing this for ten\\nhours, man. I’ve got nothing left in me.”\\nAndy said, “We need it two more times, buddy.”\\nThe prospect of this made me burst into tears. We both laughed and\\nagreed that there must be a little more in the tank. (I actually find dramaticacting easier to do than comedic acting. I look at a scene and think, \\nI don’t\\nhave to be funny? This will be a snap.\\n I have been nominated for four Emmys\\nin my life so far. One in comedy, and three in drama.)\\nBut I was starting to come up with some fun strategies to tap into real\\nfeelings and to be more of a leading man than a funny sitcom actor. At noon\\nat the Stratosphere Hotel in Vegas they have a big firework show—I told\\nSalma to look at the hotel then because that was how \\nmy\\n character felt when\\nhe first met \\nher\\n character.\\nSalma had tried her best, too—she came into my trailer at the start of the\\nshoot and said, “Let’s just spoon a little bit.”\\nI did my best Chandler impression—the double-take-and-sardonic-stare\\nthing—and said, “Oh, \\nOK!\\n Let’s just spoon a \\nlittle\\n bit!”\\nSalma always had a very elaborate and lengthy idea about how to do a\\nscene, but her long-winded ideas weren’t always helpful. There’s one scene\\nin which I’m professing my love for her. She suggested that we don’t look at\\neach other—rather, we should look out at our future together. After listening\\nto this nonsense for about twenty minutes, I finally said: “Listen, Salma,” I\\nsaid, “I’m telling you I love you in this scene. You look wherever you want,\\nbut I’m going to be looking at \\nyou.\\n”\\nThroughout the making of the movie, I had been going through the script\\nand pitching jokes to Andy Tennant, who was a very smart and incredibly\\nnice guy. He sat on me—I was bouncing around doing my funny little things,\\nand he would take me aside and say, “You don’t have to do that. You’re\\ninteresting enough to watch without doing that.”\\nThat line of thinking allowed him to pull out of me one of the best\\nperformances of my career. Could this be a different way of saying \\nMatty,\\nyou’re enough,\\n the words I’ve been longing to hear my entire life? (Andy\\nwent on to direct dozens of movies, including \\nHitch,\\n starring Will Smith.\\nNice guys don’t finish last, I guess.)\\nAndy was also open to hearing pitch ideas. One day my friend Andrew\\nHill Newman was visiting me on set and came up with the line, “You are\\neverything I never knew that I always wanted.” I wrote it out and handed it to\\nAndy Tennant, who loved it, and it became the most famous line in the\\nmovie. And movie-wise, probably the best line I ever said.One day during shooting there had been a bunch of people in the background\\non Lake Mead on Jet Skis, and I asked if I could ride one during the lunch\\nbreak. But this was the start of the movie, and I was told it was too\\ndangerous.\\nBut everything back then was a yes … so I just said, “Erm, you have to\\nsay yes to that.”\\nSo, I headed out onto Lake Mead. The sun was high; the blue water\\ncrackled like a flame. As I zoomed around on the Jet Ski, in the distance I\\ncould see the Hoover Dam, where the climax of the movie would be shot, and\\nMount Wilson hovering over everything like a warning. But everything in my\\nlife was perfect. I had the most beautiful, famous woman in the world as my\\ngirlfriend; I was on the number one TV show in America; I was making a lot\\nof money shooting a movie that could only be a number one box-office\\nsmash. I revved that Jet Ski hard, feeling the loose-soft connection to the\\nwater, turning this way and that, the chop bumping me up and down on the\\nseat, my right hand turning and turning and turning, pushing that machine to\\nits limit.\\nAnd then I turned the Jet Ski hard right, but my body went straight on. I\\nwas airborne, and then I was not airborne. Once I surfaced, I looked back to\\nwhere I’d started, and there stood forty people on the shoreline, the entire\\ncrew, who had been watching me risk the entire movie, and who now all\\ndove into Lake Mead to get me.\\nWhen I got back to shore, I knew I was hurt. That night, there was a big\\nscene to shoot—the birth-of-the-baby scene, the key moment—and I had to\\nbe right for it. But everything was hurting; I had especially fucked up my\\nneck. The crew knew I was struggling, so they called a doctor, who came by\\nmy trailer and handed me a single pill in a plastic package.\\n“Take this when you’re done,” the doctor said. “Everything will be fine.”\\nI stashed that pill in my pocket, and I swear to God I think if I’d never\\ntaken it, none of the next three decades would have gone the way they did.\\nWho knows? I just know it was really bad.\\nMy character in \\nFools Rush In\\n is a real estate developer who drives a redMustang. The scene that night went on and on, but just before dawn we\\nwrapped. I could sense the sun edging closer to the horizon.\\n“Hey, can I drive that Mustang home to Vegas, do you think?” I asked.\\nI’m amazed, after the Jet Ski debacle, that they said yes to anything right\\nthen. But they did.\\nThe first light of that Nevada day was creeping over Mount Wilson when\\nI left the lot. I put the top down of that Mustang and swallowed the pill. I\\nthought about Julia; I thought about flying across Lake Mead, not a care in\\nthe world. I thought about my childhood, but it didn’t hurt, not then. As the\\npill kicked in, something clicked in me. And it’s been that click I’ve been\\nchasing the rest of my life. I thought about fame and Craig Bierko and the\\nMurray brothers and \\nFriends.\\n The summer was coming up, all pink cirrus\\nclouds and soft, desert air. \\nThis was my pink sky. I felt so good that if a\\nlocomotive hit me, I would simply turn to the engineer and say, “It happens,\\nbrother.” I was lying in the grass in Canada in my backyard, surrounded once\\nagain with Murray puke. I couldn’t believe how good I felt; I was in complete\\nand pure euphoria. The pill had replaced the blood in my body with warm\\nhoney. I was on top of the world. It was the greatest feeling I’d ever had.\\nNothing could ever go wrong. As I drove that red Mustang convertible to my\\nrented house in Vegas, I remember thinking, \\nIf this doesn’t kill me, I’m doing\\nthis again.\\n This is a bad memory, of course, because of what followed, but it\\nwas also a good memory. I was close to God that morning. I had felt heaven\\n—not many people get that. I shook hands with God that morning.\\nWas it God, or someone else?\\nMy first move when I got home that morning was to get in touch with that\\ndoctor and tell him that the pill had worked for the pain (I decided to leave\\nthat God part out). I went to sleep, and when I woke up, forty more of those\\npills had been delivered to my house. Eureka!\\nBe careful, Matty, something that feels that good must come with\\nconsequences.\\n I know the consequences now—boy, do I ever. But I didn’t\\nknow them then. I wish that was all there was to say about \\nFools Rush In.\\nFun, inside-baseball stories about how movies get made. Hate to burst the\\ncelebrity-industrial complex bubble, but there are real lives going on, too,\\nbehind the glamour and the martini shots and the A-cameras. However, whatno one could tell was that someone’s life, probably the least likely candidate,\\nwas about to plummet into the gates of hell.\\nA year and a half later, I was taking fifty-five of those pills a day. I\\nweighed 128 pounds when I checked into Hazelden rehab in Minnesota, my\\nlife in ruins. I was in raw fear, certain I was going to die, having no idea what\\nhad happened to me. I wasn’t trying to die; I was just trying to feel better.\\nOf course, “Matthew Perry is in rehab” became a huge news story. I was\\nnot even granted the opportunity to work out my problems in privacy.\\nEveryone knew. It was on the covers of all the magazines—I didn’t even get\\nthe anonymity everyone else got. I was terrified. I was also young, so I\\nbounced back quickly. Within twenty-eight days, I was back on my feet again\\nand looking healthy.\\nThis was a big news story, too, but nowhere near the size of the other one.\\nMaking movies is a completely different animal from making TV. On\\nFriends,\\n if you were sad about something you’d play it up, as though you’re\\nthe saddest person in the world—basically, for the back row of the live\\naudience. There’s sort of a wink to the audience in your performance, too, as\\nif to say, “Hey, everybody, watch this. You’re going to enjoy this.” When\\nyou do a sitcom, it’s like you’re doing a one-act play every week. There are\\nthree hundred people in the audience, and you have to open up to them.\\nFilm work is much, much slower—there’s a master shot and then a\\ncloseup, and then an even \\ncloser\\n closeup. And if your character was sad, you\\nplayed him sad. There was no winking—this was the pros, baby. But on\\nFriends\\n we even \\nrehearsed\\n quickly. I remember Alec Baldwin guest starring\\nonce and saying, “You guys are going so fast!”\\nThere were guest stars all the time, which meant we always had to think\\non our feet. Sean Penn was one of my favorites—he appeared in two episodes\\nin season eight and nailed it. His story line called for me to be dressed up as a\\npink bunny rabbit (it was Halloween), so at the end of the table read, I said,\\n“I’ve always dreamed of working with Sean Penn, but I never thought I’d\\nhave to wear a pink bunny rabbit suit to do so.”\\nDespite not having an actual fourth wall of the apartment, \\nFriends\\n \\nneverbroke the metaphorical fourth wall, either. The closest we ever got was with\\nSean—I had pitched a tag (the brief end scene after the main story has\\nlanded) that had me backstage in the bunny rabbit suit. Sean walks by and I\\nsay, “Sean, can I talk to you for a second?”\\n“Sure, Matthew, what’s up?”\\n“Well, I’ve been really giving this a lot of thought. And I think you’re a\\ngood person to talk to about this.” I’m smoking as I say this, and as I put the\\ncigarette out with my huge bunny foot, I say, “I’ve been looking to transition\\nmyself into dramatic work.”\\nSean Penn looks me up and down for about five beats and just says,\\n“Good luck.”\\nIt got a great laugh at the table read. But it broke a rule we never broke in\\nten years. Even someone as powerful as Sean Penn and me looking ridiculous\\nin a huge pink bunny costume could not get the go-ahead to break the fourth\\nwall. It stayed in place. Right where it should be.\\nEverybody had their particular years on \\nFriends\\n when the whole world was\\ntalking about their character. David Schwimmer’s was the first season;\\nseason two, it was Lisa; seasons five and six were Courteney and me; Jen was\\nseasons seven and eight, and Matt (Most Improved Friend) was nine and ten.\\nSome of them won Emmys for those seasons and all of us should have won\\nmore than we did, but I think there’s a bias against attractive rich people with\\nan apartment that’s way too big for reality in New York City … except, as I\\nalways pointed out, there was no fourth wall.\\nDuring that first year—David’s year—he showed up one day at my\\ndressing room. He had brought an original hangdog expression to his\\ncharacter and was just damn funny. He was also the first one of us to shoot a\\ncommercial, be on \\nThe Tonight Show,\\n buy a house, get his own \\nmovie. He\\nwas the hot guy that first year, and rightly so. He had been hilarious.\\nThat day in my dressing room, he sat down opposite me and started in.\\n“Matty,” he said, “I’ve been thinking. When we renegotiate our contracts,\\nwe should do it as a team. We should all get paid the same amount.” He was\\nby far the one in the best position to negotiate. I could not believe what hewas saying. Needless to say, I was thrilled. I was perfectly happy to take\\nadvantage of his generosity of spirit.\\nIt was a decision that proved to be extremely lucrative down the line.\\nDavid had certainly been in a position to go for the most money, and he\\ndidn’t. I would like to think that I would have made the same move, but as a\\ngreedy twenty-five-year-old, I’m not sure I would have. But his decision\\nserved to make us take care of each other through what turned out to be a\\nmyriad of stressful network negotiations, and it gave us a tremendous amount\\nof power. By season eight, we were making a million dollars per episode; by\\nseason ten we were making even more. We were making $1,100,040 an\\nepisode, and we were asking to do \\nfewer\\n episodes. Morons, all of us. We had\\nDavid’s goodness, and his astute business sense, to thank for what we had\\nbeen offered. I owe you about $30 million, David. (We were still morons.)\\nBeing on \\nFriends\\n was one of those unicorn situations where the news just\\nkept getting better and better. But off-screen, things weren’t going so well. In\\nlate April 1996, I went on Jay Leno and admitted I was single. Dating Julia\\nRoberts had been too much for me. I had been constantly certain that she was\\ngoing to break up with me—why would she not? I was not enough; I could\\nnever be enough; I was broken, bent, unlovable. So instead of facing the\\ninevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the beautiful and brilliant Julia\\nRoberts. She might have considered herself slumming it with a TV guy, and\\nTV guy was now breaking up with her. I can’t begin to describe the look of\\nconfusion on her face.\\nI decided to party in Cape Cod with the Murray brothers. I have no idea\\nwhy I chose Cape Cod, or why the Murray brothers came with me. I\\nimagined it was just a new place to barhop. It was there that I noticed that\\nsomething had changed, though—a new dynamic was at play. Girls were\\ncoming up and talking to me; the days of nervously approaching women with\\nmediocre lines were over. I just stood in a corner, a vodka tonic in hand, and\\nthey came to me.\\nNone of them were Julia Roberts, though.\\nI’ve detoxed over sixty-five times in my life—but the first was when I wastwenty-six.\\nMy Vicodin habit had now kicked in badly. If you watch season three of\\nFriends,\\n I hope you’ll be horrified at how thin I am by the end of the season\\n(opioids fuck with your appetite, plus they make you vomit constantly). In\\nthe final episode, you’ll see that I’m wearing a white shirt, and tan slacks, and\\nboth look at least three sizes too big for me. (Compare this to the difference\\nin how I look between the final episode of season six and the first of season\\nseven—the Chandler-Monica proposal episodes. I’m wearing the same\\nclothes in the final episode of six and the first of seven [it’s supposed to be\\nthe same night], but I must have lost fifty pounds in the off-season. My\\nweight varied between 128 pounds and 225 pounds during the years of\\nFriends.\\n)\\nYou can track the trajectory of my addiction if you gauge my weight from\\nseason to season—when I’m carrying weight, it’s alcohol; when I’m skinny,\\nit’s pills. When I have a \\ngoatee,\\n it’s \\nlots\\n of pills.\\nBy the end of season three, I was spending most of my time figuring out\\nhow to get fifty-five Vicodin a day—I had to have fifty-five every day,\\notherwise I’d get so sick. It was a full-time job: making calls, seeing doctors,\\nfaking migraines, finding crooked nurses who would give me what I needed.\\nIt had taken me a while to realize what was happening. At the start, I’d\\nbeen taking something like twelve a day, and then went cold turkey one day,\\nand felt absolutely terrible. \\nSomething’s really wrong with me,\\n I thought, but\\nI kept going and kept going. \\nI’ll finish the season of\\n Friends \\nand then I’ll get\\ntreatment for this.\\nI almost killed myself by that decision. Had the season lasted another\\nmonth, I would no longer be here.\\nI was never high while I was working. I loved those people—I wanted to\\nalways step up for them, and I was the second baseman for the New York\\nYankees. But addiction wakes up before you do, and it wants you alone.\\nAlcoholism will win every time. As soon as you raise your hand and say,\\n“I’m having a problem,” alcohol sneers, \\nYou’re gonna\\n say \\nsomething about\\nit? Fine, I’ll go away for a while. But I’ll be back.\\nIt never goes away for good.\\nI had quickly booked another movie, \\nAlmost Heroes,\\n a comedy starringChris Farley and directed by Christopher Guest. They paid me $2 million for\\nthat. We shot it in the shitty part of Northern California, up near Eureka.\\nFarley was just as funny as you’d imagine, though his addictions, plus mine,\\nmeant that we barely were able to even finish the fucking thing. I was\\nshooting \\nFriends\\n and \\nAlmost Heroes\\n at the same time, and I was tired. The\\npills were not doing what they used to do. I had to take a certain number just\\nto not feel sick all the time.\\nEating got in the way of the high, too, so I never ate. Plus, I was always\\nso sick I didn’t want to eat. I was constantly vomiting. This was fine in\\nprivate, but not great when you are in the middle of the woods talking to\\nChristopher Guest. \\nYou are going to throw up in thirty seconds. Better figure\\nout a way to excuse yourself and fast.\\n I vomited behind trees, behind rocks, in\\nladies’ rooms. I had heard tell of people looking through their own vomit for\\nchunks of pills that they could take again, but I couldn’t bring myself to do\\nthat. I already had so many doctors on the \\npayroll I was rarely in that kind of\\nneed anyway. But I did have two towels next to my toilet—one to wipe away\\nthe vomit and one to wipe away the tears. I was dying, but I couldn’t tell\\nanyone about it.\\nThen, Chris Farley died. His disease had progressed faster than mine had.\\n(Plus, I had a healthy fear of the word “heroin,” a fear we did not share.) I\\npunched a hole through Jennifer Aniston’s dressing room wall when I found\\nout. \\nKeanu Reeves walks among us.\\n I had to promote \\nAlmost Heroes\\n two\\nweeks after he died; I found myself publicly discussing his death from drugs\\nand alcohol.\\nI was high the entire time.\\nNo one knew—not my family, my friends, no one. I was impossibly sick\\nall the time. I would try to quit every now and then—three days here, four\\ndays there—but it just made me so sad and sick that it was impossible to\\nsustain.\\nI was home one night, trying to make sense of all of it, when a call came\\nin from an ex-girlfriend.\\n“I know there is something wrong with you,” she said. “And I am taking\\nyou to a doctor.”\\nI crumbled. I told her everything. I had never cried that much in my life.The secret was out. Someone else knew.\\nI saw a doctor the next day. He told me to go to Hazelden.\\n“They have a big lake, there,” the doctor said, and I figured, \\nIt’s\\nMinnesota—close enough to Canada. At least I’ll feel at home in the shitty\\nweather.\\nBut I was scared out of my mind. This was real, now. I was on my way to\\nrehab. I was twenty-six years old.\\nI went to Hazelden to kick pills and managed to learn precisely nothing.\\nThe plan was that before I trekked up to Minnesota I’d go through a rapid\\ndetox. In a rapid detox they put you out for two or three days \\nand fill you\\nwith antagonists for opiates. By the end of it, you’re supposed to be sober.\\n(By the way, I know now that it doesn’t work, even though it’s still used as a\\ntreatment.)\\nSo, I did the rapid detox and \\nthen\\n went up to Hazelden, but once I arrived,\\nI felt like death. What they say about opioid detoxes is they can’t kill you, but\\nthey can make you wish that you were dead. (The detoxes that \\ncan\\n kill you\\nare alcohol and benzos.) I was in my room at Hazelden and I was incredibly\\nsick—I kicked like a fucking dog. Legs, arms, jerking and herking in sheer\\nterror. I was continually begging for some relief, only to be told “you’re\\ndetoxed, just relax.”\\nBut I was not detoxed—I’d merely gone from fifty-five Vicodin a day to\\nzero Vicodin a day, basically cold turkey. I became what was called a “wall\\nhugger”—to even move a few steps I had to grab onto the nearest wall.\\nI know now that if I hadn’t done the rapid detox, I would have been given\\nsomething to ease the agony, but they thought I’d detoxed, so they let me be.\\nGoing from fifty-five to nothing shows I was at least a fucking strong person\\nI suppose, but it was the purest form of hell.\\nAbout ten days into my stay, I was in a group session when everything\\ngot a little fuzzy. I’m told I kept saying “I’m fine, totally fine,” but I was not\\nfine. My childhood training—that I could never be a bad boy—was so strong\\nI guess that even while having a grand mal seizure I had to make sure I didn’t\\nrock the boat.When I woke up from the seizure, I was back in my room, and all the\\nstaff had gathered, terrified. Not knowing what had happened, and clearly\\nstill deeply confused, I said, “Oh my God, I can’t believe you guys came to\\nCalifornia to see me. That’s so nice!”\\n“You’re not in California,” someone said, “you’re in Minnesota. You had\\na grand mal seizure.”\\nI stayed for another two weeks, and by the end of it, I felt like I ran \\nthe\\nplace, I was the king of the place. And the way I managed that was simply to\\nimitate Michael Keaton in \\nClean and Sober.\\nI was young enough that I put some weight on, played a bunch of tennis,\\nand stopped taking pills. But inside I knew I was going to drink again. Once I\\nfelt better, I headed back to California—I wasn’t back to normal, but I felt\\nfine. But as I said, I had learned precisely nothing about what was wrong\\nwith me. I hadn’t learned about AA, or how to live a sober life; I’d just gotten\\noff the Vicodin. For those of you watching, this was the beginning of season\\nfour—the best I ever looked on the show. Still not good enough for Jennifer\\nAniston, but pretty fucking good.\\nBack in Cali, I lasted sixty-eight days and then I had my first drink, my\\ntheory being that drinking wasn’t the thing that had almost killed me. It was\\nopiates that almost killed me; vodka had only ever filled the holes, and as the\\nholes were still there, something had to fill them.\\nI drank every night until 2001.\\nThe run-up to Hazelden had been probably the best year of my life, the best\\nyear anyone could ever wish for. The joys of fame had not quite worn off,\\nthough if I’d died then, my headstone would have read either: \\nHERE LIES\\nMATTHEW PERRY—HE BROKE UP WITH JULIA ROBERTS\\n or, \\nCOULD I\\n \\nBE\\n \\nMORE STUPID\\nAND DEAD?\\nIn 1999, I fell hard for a woman I was working with on a movie. (I was\\nstarting to have a track record of falling for women who were famous, just as\\nmy mother had been in Canada.) All the walls dropped, and I was just\\nmyself … and then she picked somebody else to be in love with.\\nI’ve been able to get most people I’ve wanted, but this one still hurts.Which just shows that the exception proves the rule: when I can get someone,\\nI have to leave them before they leave me, because I’m not enough and I’m\\nabout to be found out, but when someone I want doesn’t \\nchoose me, that just\\nproves I’m not enough and I’ve been found out. Heads they win, tails I lose.\\nEither way, to this day if someone mentions her name, my stomach clenches.\\nThe fear that drives my every waking minute had come true. She had even\\nmentioned that my drinking was a problem—just another thing that addiction\\nhas cost me. You would think that might knock somebody sober, but it\\nactually made it worse. I lit candles all over my house, drank, watched the\\nmovie we were in together, torturing myself, alone, heartsick, trying to get\\nover it. Failing.\\nI was bloated and looked awful, and it was dangerous.\\nI remember realizing when I was in ninth grade in Ottawa that Michael J.\\nFox had both the number one movie and the number one TV show at the\\nsame time, and even then, at the age of fourteen, steam came out of my ears\\nwith envy. Later, I told \\nThe New York Times,\\n “You want the attention, you\\nwant the bucks, and you want the best seat in the restaurant.” Fast-forward to\\nthe hiatus between seasons five and six of \\nFriends\\n and I found myself filming\\nThe Whole Nine Yards,\\n and sure enough, when it came out in early 2000, I\\nhad the number one TV show and the number one movie.\\nMe? I was taking so many pills that I couldn’t leave my bedroom. So, in a\\nmoment when you’d think Matthew Perry would be celebrating and being the\\ntoast of the town, I was just handling drug dealers and living in dark rooms\\nand misery.\\nIn nature, when a penguin is injured, the other penguins group around it\\nand prop it up until it’s better. This is what my costars on \\nFriends\\n did for me.\\nThere were times on set when I was extremely hungover, and Jen and\\nCourteney, being devoted to cardio as a cure-all, had a Lifecycle exercise\\nbike installed backstage. In between rehearsals and takes, I’d head back there\\nand ride that thing like the fires of hell were chasing me—anything to get my\\nbrain power back to normal. I was \\nthe injured penguin, but I was determined\\nto not let these wonderful people, and this show, down.But still, the addiction ravaged me—one time, in a scene in the\\ncoffeehouse when I’m dressed in a suit, I fell asleep right there on the couch,\\nand disaster was averted only when Matt LeBlanc nudged me awake right\\nbefore my line; no one noticed, but I knew how close I’d come.\\nBut I always showed up, and always had the lines.\\nAnd then I got pancreatitis. I was thirty years old.\\nIt was during hiatus. I was alone, again, there was nothing going on—no\\nmovie to shoot, nothing, just slow, tar-like time, slipping down the LA\\ncanyons toward the endless sea. I was just sitting at home for months\\ndrinking—alone so I could drink; drinking, therefore alone. (As I said,\\nalcoholism is desperate to get you on your own.) I was watching the movie\\nMeet Joe Black\\n on repeat, even though it’s about the character Death (me),\\ntrying to figure out what love is. Perfect. But it was as if I were Joe Black\\nmyself, repeatedly being asked, “What do we do now?” I was like death—I’d\\ndrink, watch the movie, pass out, wake up, drink, watch that movie, pass out.\\nThen, out of nowhere, I felt a knife slide into my stomach, just like that. It\\npierced the membrane, twisted a little, its serrated edge catching on the veins,\\nheating my blood to boiling and beyond. As that knife got deeper and deeper,\\nI heard myself screaming in pain, an animal being ripped to shreds up in the\\ncanyons.\\nI called my sort-of girlfriend at the time, the wonderful Jamie Tarses, and\\nmanaged to say, “There’s something \\nwrong.\\n”\\nJamie was an angel from God—she drove straight over to my house,\\npoured me into a car, and drove me to the nearest hospital.\\nIn the ER I was screaming, “You gotta pump my stomach! You gotta\\npump my stomach!”\\nThe doctor just stared at me.\\n“I don’t need to pump your stomach. It’s not food poisoning.”\\n“Then what the fuck is it?” I wailed.\\n“You have pancreatitis,” he said. “Which is something you can only get\\nfrom drinking too much.”\\nThere are a few causes of pancreatitis, actually—you can have an\\nautoimmune disease, or an infection, or gallstones, but mostly you get it from\\ndrinking a fuck-ton of alcohol. Pancreatitis at the age of thirty was unheardof. Yay for me! Another record.\\n“Fuck that,” I said, “no. I don’t drink too much.…” It could have been\\nshame; it could have been denial. I think they’re hard to tell apart. Whatever\\nit was, I made Jamie drive me home.\\nAfter about an hour at my house, I knew something was still seriously\\nwrong, so this time we went to a different hospital, but got the same answer.\\nFor thirty days and nights I was in the hospital, fed fluids through an IV\\n(the only way to treat pancreatitis was to leave the pancreas completely alone,\\nwhich meant I could not eat or drink anything for about thirty days); and for\\nevery one of those nights, I’d fall asleep with Jamie Tarses by my side—she\\nhad a bed moved in, the whole bit—so I’d wake up to find her there, too. (I\\nstill believe Jamie was a messenger from a benevolent God, and that none of\\nus were worthy of her—I know I wasn’t.) We’d watch \\nThe West Wing\\n over\\nand over while I smoked—yes, I smoked in my hospital room. It was a\\ndifferent time, or I was so fucking famous at the time that it didn’t matter. At\\none point they caught me and told me to stop. But I was desperate, so I\\nchecked myself out of the hospital, had a cigarette, and then checked myself\\nback in.\\nIt took seven hours to go through intake again. It was worth it.\\nTo ease the pain they hooked me up to a machine that administered\\nregular amounts of a drug called Dilaudid. It is an opioid that changes the\\nbrain’s relationship to pain—if only it came in human form. But I loved\\nDilaudid—it was my new favorite drug, and I would have stayed in that\\nhospital for a hundred days if they kept administrating it. For \\nthose thirty\\ndays I had Jamie at my side, and I was high and happy. Especially happy\\nwhen I signed the deal for seasons six and seven, the deal that, owing to\\nDavid Schwimmer’s selfless and brilliant idea, brought us $50 million. I\\nsigned that contract with a feeding tube in my arm and Dilaudid flowing\\nthrough my brain.\\nBut they were onto me—clearly, I was asking for too much of the wonder\\ndrug.\\n“You’re fine,” one doctor said. “Your pancreatitis is over. You have to go\\nhome. Tomorrow.”\\n“You mean you’re not going to give me Dilaudid \\ntonight\\n?”“No,” he said, “we are \\nnot.\\n”\\nSomehow, I got through the night, but nobody knew what to do with me.\\nEnter, stage left, my father. Bless him, he offered to have me live with\\nhim and his family in Ojai, a town northwest of LA.\\n“Come live with us,” he said, “go to some AA meetings. Get yourself\\nstraight.”\\nIt was an OK option, and with nothing else to do, I headed back to my\\nhome on Chelan Way in the Hollywood Hills to pick up some things. I was\\nsober, but I had just been on Dilaudid for thirty days, so I was still a little out\\nof it. Jamie waited while I packed a bag, then I followed her in my green\\nPorsche out along the winding roads in the Hills. As I made my first left onto\\nChelan Drive there was a courier van right in the middle of the road coming\\ntoward me, so I swerved and pumped the brakes, but the car hit some grass\\nand just kept going and I drove into the stairs leading up to a house,\\ndemolishing them, and then on into the living room. Fortunately, no one was\\nhome, but the car was a wreck, and so were the stairs.\\nFucking stairwells once again.\\nI did the right thing and waited for the cops to arrive. I kept glancing up at\\nthe sky, wondering when the next cartoon anvil was going to \\nfall on my head.\\nI was there long enough for someone to take a picture and sell it to \\nPeople\\nmagazine—my car in a house, me on the way to staying with my father in\\nOjai.\\nIt was like I was fifteen again, living with my dad in California. A car\\nwould come to pick me up every day to take me to film \\nFriends\\n. But it wasn’t\\ntoo long until I picked up Vicodin again, and then started fucking drinking\\nagain, and liking it again. To quote my therapist, “Reality is an acquired\\ntaste,” and I had failed to acquire it. I was sneaking both drugs and alcohol\\ninto my dad’s house, and his wife was so angry that eventually my father\\nvery calmly approached me and told me that I had to leave.\\nOh, I’ll leave, but neither of you will ever see a dime of my money, ever,\\n I\\nthought, but I did not say.\\nI returned for the next season of \\nFriends\\n high as a kite, and everyone\\nknew that something had to be done.\\nI had already heard about methadone, a drug that promised to remove afifty-five-a-day Vicodin habit in one day with one little sip. The only catch\\nwas, you had to drink that little sip every day, or you would go into serious\\nwithdrawal. \\nSounds good to me,\\n my desperate mind thought. I got on the drug\\nimmediately and was able to return to \\nFriends\\n the next day, sharp as a tack.\\nI had been told that methadone had no side effects. This was not true. In\\nfact, it was the beginning of the end.\\nOtherwise, everything else was going great. \\nFriends\\n was still as\\nsuccessful as ever. And then another cast member came to my trailer. It\\nwasn’t David this time, and it wasn’t good news.\\n“I know you’re drinking,” she said.\\nI had long since gotten over her—ever since she started dating Brad Pitt, I\\nwas fine—and had worked out exactly how long to look at her \\nwithout it\\nbeing awkward, but still, to be confronted by Jennifer Aniston was\\ndevastating. And I was confused.\\n“How can you tell?” I said. I never worked drunk. “I’ve been trying to\\nhide it.…”\\n“We can smell it,” she said, in a kind of weird but loving way, and the\\nplural “we” hit me like a sledgehammer.\\n“I know I’m drinking too much,” I said, “but I don’t exactly know what\\nto do about it.”\\nSometimes I wasn’t OK to drive to set (I never worked high, but I\\ncertainly worked hungover) and I’d take a limo—that will get you some\\ndubious looks from people, let me tell you. Everyone would ask me if I was\\nall right, but nobody wanted to stop the \\nFriends\\n train because it was such a\\nmoneymaker, and I just felt horrible about it. My greatest joy was also my\\nbiggest nightmare—I was this close to messing up this wonderful thing.\\nEventually I got a sober companion at work with me, but it wasn’t really\\nhelping. One day I had taken some kind of medication and had drunk the\\nnight before, and it all kicked in during a run-through in front of everyone.\\nBut there was a curious twist to this one: I was hammered but didn’t know it,\\nso I thought there was nothing to hide. I didn’t know that I was wasted, but I\\nwas slurring. Folks couldn’t understand a word that came out of my mouth.But I had no idea.\\nOnce again, I went back to my dressing room and everybody from the\\nshow was there.\\n“What are you going to do, Matty?” they said.\\n“It’s medication, I’ll fix it. I’m sorry.”\\nI didn’t drink that night and the next day I showed up to work, but I was\\non thin ice.\\nI called my manager.\\n“Yeah,” he said, “they’re onto you.”\\nThe writers, the cast—fuck, \\neverybody\\n—knew, so I said, “You gotta get\\nme a movie. Right now. Get me out of here.”\\nOnce again, my idea was to pull a geographic. I still thought if I removed\\nmyself from the situation I was in, I would be able to quit all the drugs and\\ndrinking and come out fighting. (All I was actually doing was tripling my\\nworkload while the drinking and drugs continued to escalate.) Because\\nwherever you go, there you are. This also reminded me of the time I’d\\nbegged for a pilot and had gotten \\nL.A.X. 2194.\\n Back then I’d had enough\\njuice to get a pilot and thereby enough money to drink at the Formosa; now,\\nas the new century dawned, I had enough juice to be able to score a movie if I\\nwanted it. \\nServing Sara\\n would be filmed in Dallas, and I have no idea why I\\nthought that would be the perfect place to get sober.…\\nServing Sara\\n was a bad movie, but it was made much worse by how bad I\\nwas in it.\\nI was in terrible shape, and I was overextended. I was working four days\\na week on the movie and then flying on a private jet back to Los Angeles to\\ndo \\nFriends.\\n On the plane I’d have a water bottle filled with vodka that I’d sip\\nfrom continually as I read over my lines. (In fact, if you’re keeping score at\\nhome, I was actually on methadone, Xanax, cocaine, and a full quart of vodka\\na day.) One day in Dallas I showed up to do a scene only to realize that we’d\\nfilmed it a few days earlier. Things were unraveling.\\nJamie Tarses—beautiful, amazing, caring, genius Jamie Tarses—flew out\\nto Texas and was basically my nurse, but I was still drinking and taking allthe drugs and trying to hide it from her. One night we were watching TV and\\nshe turned to me, and she said, “It looks like you’re disappearing.”\\nA window opened—the slightest crack, but open.\\n“I don’t want to disappear,” I whispered. “Stop everything.”\\nI called my manager, I called my father, I called everybody.\\n“I’m completely fucked-up,” I said. “I need help. I need to go to rehab.”\\nServing Sara\\n shut down, something that later cost me $650,000. Small\\nprice to save my life. \\nFriends\\n postponed my scenes. And off I went to a detox\\ncenter in Marina del Rey this time, on the west side of LA. I was a car going\\ntwo hundred miles an hour that just hit a brick wall; a green Porsche hitting a\\nstairwell. (Fucking \\nfucking\\n stairwells.)\\nThe first day they said, “Go to your room; you’re not taking any more\\ndrugs,” but they may have well said:\\n“Go to your room and just don’t breathe anymore.”\\n“But I have to breathe to live.”\\n“No. People have done it before. People have gone in there and stopped\\nbreathing.”\\nThat’s exactly what it felt like.\\nI spent one month there. One night during my stay, I was smoking a\\ncigarette and it was raining and there was a light bulb swinging in the\\nsmoking section. And I said out loud, “This is what hell is. I’m in hell.”\\nIt was in del Rey when I finally picked up the Big Book of Alcoholics\\nAnonymous. About thirty pages in I read: “These men were not drinking to\\nescape; they were drinking to overcome a craving beyond their mental\\ncontrol.”\\nI closed the book and began to weep. I’m weeping now just thinking\\nabout it. I was not alone. There was an entire group of people who thought\\nthe way I did. (And William Silkworth had written this line on July 27,\\n1938.) It was an amazing moment and a terrible moment all at the same time.\\nWhat this line meant was that I was never going to be alone again. It also\\nmeant that I was an alcoholic and would have to stop drinking and drugging\\nright now, and every day, one day at a time, for the rest of my life.\\nThe folks at Marina del Rey said, “This guy is \\nhard-core.\\n Thirty days is\\nnot going to do it for him. He needs long-term treatment.” So, from there theysent me to a Malibu rehab, where I spent the first twelve days not sleeping at\\nall. My liver enzymes were off the charts high. But after about three months I\\nstarted to get better—I took part in the groups and “did the work,” as they\\nsay.\\nI was living in rehab when Monica and Chandler got married. It was May\\n17, 2001.\\nTwo months earlier, on March 25, 2001, I’d been detoxing one night when\\nthe powers that be decided to give us all the night off to watch the Academy\\nAwards. I was lying there, sweating and twitching, filled with fear, barely\\nlistening, when Kevin Spacey stepped up to the podium and intoned:\\n“The nominees for best performance by an actress in a leading role are:\\nJoan Allen, in \\nThe Contender\\n;\\nJuliette Binoche, in \\nChocolat\\n;\\nEllen Burstyn, in \\nRequiem for a Dream\\n;\\nLaura Linney, in \\nYou Can Count on Me\\n;\\nand\\nJulia Roberts, in \\nErin Brockovich.\\n”\\nThen he said,\\n“And the Oscar goes to … \\nJulia Roberts\\n!”\\nI watched as Julia kissed her boyfriend at the time, the actor Benjamin\\nBratt, and walked up the steps to receive her award.\\n“Thank you, thank you, ever so much,” she said. “I’m \\nso\\n happy.…” As\\nshe made her speech, a voice rose in that room in that rehab, urgent, sad, soft,\\nangry, pleading, filled with longing and tears, arguing with the universe while\\nGod calmly tapped his cane on the hard, cold world.\\nI made a joke.\\n“I’ll take you back,” I said. “I’ll take you back.”\\nThe whole room laughed, though this was not a funny line in a sitcom.\\nThis was real life now. Those people on the TV were no longer my people.No, the people I was lying in front of, shaking, covered in blankets, were my\\npeople now. And I was lucky to have them. They were saving my life.\\nOn Julia’s big night in Hollywood, I crawled into bed and stared at the\\nceiling. There would be no sleep for me that night. Just thoughts racing\\nthrough my head like someone had fired a bullet into a tin can. \\nThat blue\\ntruck, that mountaintop. All the blue trucks, all mountaintops, gone, vanished\\nlike ether in a vacuum of fear.\\n I was incredibly happy for her. As for me, I\\nwas just grateful to have made it one more day. When you are at the bottom,\\nthe days are long.\\nI didn’t need an Oscar, I just needed one more day.INTERLUDE\\nHoles\\nAddiction is like the Joker. It just wants to see the whole world burn.6\\nBruce Willis\\nAfter three long months of rehab, I was feeling better.\\nBack on my feet, I was very excited to live a life that was not completely\\nruled by my alcoholism and addiction. I had stopped drinking and drugging.\\nAnd my cravings for each had disappeared. Something way, way bigger than\\nme was in charge now. Miracles do happen.\\nThe first move I made was driving to Jamie Tarses’s house.\\n“I need time to process being sober,” I said to her, “and that’s going to\\ntake up all my time. I’m incredibly grateful for all the wonderful things you\\ndid for me.”\\nI could see her face losing color.\\n“But … I can’t be in a relationship right now,” I said.\\nSo, to be clear: in order to adequately pay sweet, wonderful Jamie back\\nfor two years of giving up huge portions of her own very busy and important\\nlife by basically being my nurse, I ended our relationship. Jamie Tarses was\\none of the most magical, beautiful, smart … oh so smart. I loved the way her\\nmind worked. And I broke up with her. Proving that getting sober didn’t\\nmake \\nme\\n any smarter—in fact it may have made me a colossal idiot. Jamie\\nwas probably the most amazing person I had ever met, and she loved me. But\\nI wasn’t ready for that.\\nWhat I said to Jamie that day was all bullshit, of course. I was newly\\nsober, I was a huge star, and I wanted to sleep with every single girl in\\nSouthern California.\\nAnd, I did. [Insert cartoon anvil landing on my head here.]Because of this huge star thing, I had no problem getting dates. And this is\\nhow I opened each and every one of them.\\n“Hi, sorry I’m late.\\n“You look great by the way. I’ve been really excited to finally meet you.”\\n[Pause for appropriate positive response.]\\n“But I don’t want to get off on the wrong foot here,” I would continue. “I\\nwant to be as transparent as possible. I am an open book. Ask me anything—I\\nwill tell you the truth.”\\nMore warmth would here be shared; on a good day, she would tend to be\\nnodding along, loving my transparency, my emotional pitch, my very air of\\nsuave involvement.\\nThen, I’d bring the hammer down.\\n“I’m not sure what you are looking for, but if it’s any kind of emotional\\nattachment, I am not your man.” [Pause to let this sink in.]\\n“I’m not going to call you every day,” I went on, “and I’m not going to be\\nyour \\nboyfriend.\\n But if it’s fun you’re looking for, I. Am. \\nYour.\\n Man.”\\nThat great twentieth-century philosopher Cyndi Lauper was right as it\\nturned out—girls do in fact just want to have fun. But in case the message\\nwasn’t entirely clear, I added some salt to the heady stew I was ladling out.\\n“I’m an extremely passionate person,” I said, a little abashedly, in case\\nthey thought I protesteth too much. “In fact, I’m a bit of a romantic. Even\\nbeating up the elliptical machine, all I do is listen to songs about women in\\nsome kind of duress.\\n“But I am not looking for, or available for, any kind of emotional\\nrelationship,” I repeated, just in case the message had been a tad fuzzy. “I just\\ngot out of a long-term relationship and had just gotten sober and I am not\\nlooking to be in one now.”\\nAnd then it was time to nail the landing.\\n“Oh, did you want to look at your menu?” I’d say. “I hear the food here is\\nfantastic.”\\nIt is amazing to me how many women signed up for this after all that. I\\npresume many of them thought they could change me. What’s that you say?\\nOh yes, I did get the occasional abrupt walkout, of course. A few womenwould say, “Well, I’m not interested in that at all,” and would just get up and\\nleave. (No surprise that those were the ones that I was \\nreally\\n interested in.)\\nBut for the most part my speech worked to a tee.\\nI use the word “worked” loosely. Because I barely need to point out that\\nthe best you could say about all this was that at any point you could exchange\\nmy head for a donkey’s ass and no one would see the difference. Not only\\nhad I just broken up with the greatest woman on the planet, what I was\\nproposing was just a giant fucking waste of time. Sex is great and everything,\\nbut I think I would be a much more fulfilled person now if I had spent those\\nyears looking for something more.\\nIn a life riddled with mistakes, this may have been my biggest one. And\\nmistakes are hard to undo.\\nDuring that time, I met at least five women that I could have married, had\\nchildren with. Had I done so just once, I would not now be sitting in a huge\\nhouse, overlooking the ocean, with no one to share it with, save a sober\\ncompanion, a nurse, and a gardener twice a week—a gardener I would often\\nrun outside and give a hundred dollars to so he’d turn his fucking leaf blower\\noff. (We can put a man on the moon, but we can’t invent a silent one of those\\nthings?)\\nNatasha Wagner was one of these women. Not only is she beautiful,\\nsmart, caring, and sexy, she’s also the daughter of Natalie Wood and Richard\\nGregson (and raised by Robert Wagner, and then by Robert Wagner and Jill\\nSt. John after her mother’s tragic death). Natasha had it all; she was perfect!\\nBut I wasn’t looking for \\nperfect,\\n I was looking for \\nmore.\\n More, more, more.\\nSo, because I’d done the speech at her, and then not properly dated her, we\\nparted ways, and I was left to find even more perfect women when in fact I’d\\nalready found them.\\nA few years later I was driving on the Pacific Coast Highway one day in\\nsome kind of fuck-off-everybody car, a car so amazing that I now cannot for\\nthe life of me remember what make it was. I had the top down; the glistening\\nsun was picking the edges of the surf out in the ocean and turning it into a\\nslippery silver. Dudes on surfboards lounged around waiting for The One,\\nwhich never came; I knew exactly how they felt.\\nThen, my phone rang. It was Natasha. She had fallen for me after one ofthese dates, so she had had to go—\\nthat’s the rule, Matty, that’s the rule!\\n—but\\nsomehow, even though I’d jettisoned her, she was still a friend.\\n“Hey, Matty!” she said in her inimitably sunny way. She was as bright as\\nthe sun on the ocean, always. Sometimes I had to look away just to get my\\nbearings back.\\n“Hey, Natasha! How are you?” I said. It was so lovely to hear from her.\\n“What’s going on with you?”\\nPerhaps, if she was calling me, there was a chance that we…?\\n“I’m a mother!” she announced. “I just had a baby girl. Clover!”\\n“Oh…,” I said, then quickly recovered, or thought I did. “That’s fantastic\\nnews, babe. I love that name, too!”\\nWe talked for a little while longer, then we got off the phone. And then,\\nout of nowhere, the fuck-you-everybody car was pulling over—\\nbecause \\nI\\n was\\npulling it over—and I lurched to a stop on the verge. The sun was still high,\\nthe surfers were up on their boards, but I was utterly thunderstruck with\\nemotion. The giant wave everyone was looking for was happening in my\\nhead.\\n“She could have had that child with me,” I said, to no one, as I sobbed\\nlike a newborn myself.\\nI was so sad and alone. I cried for about forty-five minutes until,\\ngradually, a new thought came, like clouds across the sky above an ocean:\\nJesus, this is quite a reaction.…\\nIt behooved me to work out why I’d broken down so hard. I sat there,\\nwondering, and wondering, until I finally realized what the fuck had I been\\ndoing: I’d been looking for an hour or two of pleasure with every woman\\never invented when there was so much life I was missing. Is this why I got\\nsober? To sleep with women? Surely God had something better in store for\\nme than that.\\nI would need to find out, and fast. Natasha’s life was blossoming while\\nmine was turning into one huge mistake.\\nWhen I try to work out how sobriety and addiction work for me, I keep\\ncoming back to this line: \\nI’m capable of staying sober unless\\n anythinghappens.\\nSome quiet days, when I was sober, I’d think back to the recent past and\\nwonder why I’d ever picked up pills or drugs after getting clean. When I was\\nsober, strong, and feeling like a normal person, I’d sometimes have a fantasy\\nof putting on a baseball cap and shades and heading off to mingle with the\\nregular people poking around the La Brea Tar Pits or standing next to some\\ncelebrity’s star on the Walk of Fame, just to see what it’s like. Not in the\\nsense of “I’m a star, I’m better than them”; no, in the sense of “Oh, so this is\\nwhat a sober life feels like.”\\nBut I was still so often just a tourist in sobriety. It was so hard to put\\ndown roots in it. Why was it so hard for me, when I’d seen hundreds around\\nme do it with impunity?\\nI was dating literally everyone and anyone in LA, but I’d also met a\\nwoman in New York I really liked. I was not faithful to her, but I loved her. I\\nwas newly sober, and famous, and I wanted to fuck everybody in Los\\nAngeles County; many reciprocated my desires. My speech worked far more\\nthan it had the right to. But the woman I loved in New York was like a good\\nmom—a great caretaker and so beautiful, so of course I was drawn to her\\nand, of course, I screwed it up. But it wasn’t all bad—in LA, I was also\\nworking to help other alcoholics get sober—sponsoring people, answering\\ncalls whenever needed, imparting advice. \\nFriends\\n was a juggernaut, too, and\\nI didn’t have to worry about fucking \\nthat\\n up—I was clean, and I was about to\\nhave \\nmy\\n season, the one where everyone was talking about Chandler. (Nine\\nwas the only year I was completely sober for a \\nFriends\\n season. Care to\\nhazard a guess as to which was the only year I got nominated for an Emmy\\nfor best actor in a comedy? Yup, season nine. If that doesn’t tell you\\nsomething, nothing will. What did I do differently that season? I \\nlistened.\\n I\\ndidn’t just stand there and wait for my turn to speak. Sometimes in acting, it’s\\nmore powerful to listen than to talk. I have tried to incorporate that in real\\nlife, too. \\nKnow more, say less.\\n That’s my new mantra.)\\nThe two years flew by; maybe this is what normal people feel. Maybe I’d\\nfound my calling; beyond \\nFriends,\\n beyond movie stardom, beyond\\neverything, I was here to help people get and stay sober.\\nAnd then, something happened, and \\nI’m capable of staying sober unlessanything \\nhappens.\\nOne of the women I’d used the speech on had grown attached to me, and\\nas we know, dear reader, if that happens, I have to backpedal.\\nSo, that’s what I did. I said, “I \\ndon’t\\n love you. I warned you when I met\\nyou.… Remember the speech, when I asked you about the menu?”\\nBut it was too late. Some kind of agony-hook was in her; it was my fault.\\nIs this why I got sober? To sleep with women? And then hurt them? Surely\\nGod had something better in store for me than that.\\nShe was staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel at the time, and I went to see\\nher, but she could not be consoled. She reminded me of my mother—no\\nmatter how much charm I used, no matter which funny thing I said, I could\\nnot help her pain.\\nEventually, she stormed off into the bathroom, leaving me alone in the\\nroom. On the side table, there was a knocked-over bottle of Vicodin. Three of\\nthe pills had spilled out under the glare of the bedside lamp. She was locked\\nin the bathroom, screaming; I couldn’t take care of the situation. This was the\\nanything\\n that was happening. So, I took three of the pills, and somehow made\\nit through the night, but I had thereby ended two years of sobriety.\\nI was in deep, deep shit again. Because once you puncture the membrane\\nof sobriety, the phenomenon of craving kicks in, and you’re off to the races\\none more time.\\nIt was impossible for me to get back. I graduated quickly to getting my\\nown pills. And then I was drinking again. I was knowingly surfing down a\\nlong slide to oblivion. But it was bigger than me—there was literally nothing\\nI could do about it.\\nLooking back, all I would have had to do was to tell someone about it, but\\nthat would mean I would have to stop. But stopping was not an option.\\nAt one point in 1999, I was sitting alone in my way-too-big house at the top\\nof Carla Ridge, yet another house with a beautiful view, this time of the Los\\nAngeles Basin. Down there, somewhere, normal Los Angeles life was going\\non (Tar Pits; Walk of Fame)—up here, I was just waiting it out—drink in one\\nhand, a steady flow of Marlboro Lights \\nin the other. We were five seasonsinto \\nFriends\\n; Ross and Rachel had just stumbled out of a chapel married,\\nahead of Chandler and Monica. \\nFriends\\n was a cultural touchstone, a\\nshorthand for the millennium, the number one show on the planet, everyone’s\\nfavorite watch.\\nAnd that way of speaking! “Could this \\nbe\\n any hotter?” had swept the\\nnation, and now everyone was talking that way. Clinton was in the White\\nHouse; the date September 11 meant nothing special, unless it was your\\nbirthday or your wedding anniversary. All the water in the world was flowing\\ndownhill into a sparkling lake, upon which the most beautiful, nameless birds\\nendlessly floated.\\nNow, a messenger was at my door, interrupting my reverie. It was as if I\\nwas reenacting what had once happened to the Romantic poet Coleridge, who\\nhad been interrupted from his own buzz—he got his via opium—by the\\nlegendary “person from Porlock.” At the time, Coleridge had the entirety of\\nhis poem “Kubla Kahn” memorized in his opiate-addled mind, but the\\nmessenger who had arrived at his door that day in 1797 had shattered that\\nmemory, leaving only fifty-four lines for posterity.\\nI was no Coleridge, but my buzz had been notable all the same—the view\\nand the vodka tonic and the sweet Marlboro burn had rendered me into a safe\\nplace, where I was no longer unaccompanied, where somehow, back there in\\nthe house behind me, a beautiful wife and a gaggle of amazing kids were\\ntumbling around in the playroom while Daddy had some quality time alone in\\nhis screening room. (You want to feel lonely? Watch a movie alone in a\\nscreening room.) It was at times like these, when the haze was deepest, that I\\ncould imagine my life was not filled with holes, that the minefield that was\\nmy past had been metal-detected by men in hazard suits into a benign and\\nbeautiful safety.\\nBut now my doorbell was buzzing, killing my buzz, and because there\\nwas no wife, no kids, it was up to me to reluctantly answer it. \\nThe “person\\nfrom Porlock” handed me a package, inside of which was a script entitled\\nThe Whole Nine Yards.\\n And my manager had written on it, “Could be pay\\ndirt.”\\nIt was no “Kubla Khan,” but I could see it was going to be huge.\\nI was always bad at reading scripts. Back then, I’d be offered millions ofdollars to do movies and barely crack the first few pages. I’m embarrassed to\\nadmit that now, given that these days I’m writing scripts myself and it’s like\\npulling teeth to get actors to respond. Maybe they feel how I used to feel: that\\nin a life of fun and fame and money, reading a script, no matter the size of the\\nnumber attached, feels all too much like school.\\nThe universe will teach you, though. All those years I was too \\nthis,\\n too\\nthat,\\n to read a script, but last year I wrote a screenplay for myself and was\\ntrying get it made until I realized that I was too old to play the part. Most\\nfifty-three-year-olds have worked their shit out already, so I needed to hire a\\nthirty-year-old. The one I chose took weeks and weeks to respond, and I\\ncouldn’t believe how rude his behavior was.\\n“Do I still have enough juice to even get an independent movie made?” I\\nasked my manager, Doug, in frustration.\\n“Not really,” Doug said.\\nBut back then in 1999, my “person from Porlock” had brought me a script\\nthat even I could see had potential, and that potential was that none other than\\nBruce Willis was attached.\\nAt the turn of the century, there was no bigger movie star than Bruce Willis.\\nHe’d already banked \\nLook Who’s Talking\\n and its sequel, the \\nDie Hard\\nfranchise, \\nPulp Fiction.…\\n There was no one more successful back then. Not\\nto mention that it would be a welcome relief from the seventy-two romantic\\ncomedies I’d just completed. Mitchell Kapner had written a funny script,\\nfilled with twists and turns, and it was easy \\nto read: always a good sign. Best\\nof all, Bruce Willis was in it, and I played the lead character. Show me an\\nacclaimed and successful TV star and I will show you a frustrated wannabe\\nmovie star.\\nPay dirt? You bet your ass. But first, I had to get through a dinner with\\nthe director and my costar’s brother.\\nI showed up the next night at Citrus on Melrose. Back then, this was \\nthe\\nHollywood restaurant: expensive, exclusive, jacket required, a line of\\npaparazzi at the door clicking away madly at everyone who came and went.\\nThat night, the comings and goings were me; the film’s director, JonathanLynn, a short round British man who’d made \\nMy Cousin Vinny\\n and who just\\nso happened to be Oliver Sacks’s cousin; and one of the film’s producers,\\nBruce’s brother, David (David got the hair, by the way, Bruce got the chin).\\nI had donned the requisite movie-star black suit for the dinner; I’d arrived\\na minute or two late, just because that’s what movie stars do. The dinner went\\nreally well, even if no one touched their food, in the standard Hollywood\\nway. Jonathan was very smart and funny—he had that dry, British approach\\nto humor in which he’d say something that was seemingly serious, but there\\nwould be a twinkle in his eye, just enough to signal that he was busting balls.\\nDavid was attentive and interesting and smart; as for me, well, I had already\\ndecided to do the movie. The original script had no physical comedy in it, so\\nI said things like, “I think this would be a great opportunity for some physical\\ncomedy, and I’d be more than willing to fall down a flight of stairs and leap\\ndown some mountaintops to work with Bruce Willis.”\\nJonathan and David laughed and seemed relieved. Eventually, the\\n“dinner” wrapped up. Jonathan said, “Well, you’re our guy—we really want\\nyou to do this.” Hands shaken, and paparazzi ignored, I jumped into my\\nforest-green Porsche and squealed away.\\nI’m gonna be the lead in a Bruce Willis movie,\\n I thought, as once again,\\nall the lights on Sunset were green. Back at my house on Carla \\nRidge, the\\nmoon had come up, lonely, mournful, casting a strange and awkward shadow\\nacross my view. I put on the TV, poured a vodka tonic, and waited.\\nThe stars were lining up again; had the rise and rise of Matthew Perry just\\ntaken yet another giant leap forward? This is what I thought as the \\nactual\\nstars rose in a clear, dark sky. I started to count them, even though I knew the\\nsuperstition that once you reach a hundred, you die.\\nI stopped at ninety-nine, just in case.\\nThe following morning, I got a message on my answering machine.\\n“Matthew, this is Bruce Willis. Call me back, or I’ll burn your house\\ndown and break both your knees and arms and you’ll be left with just the\\nstubs for hands and feet for the rest of your life.”\\nClick, dial tone.I figured this was a call I should probably return.\\nA few days later we met at Ago, yet another fancy Italian restaurant in\\nHollywood, in the private room in the back, the one that’s reserved for people\\nof Mr. Willis’s status. Once again, I jetted up in my Porsche, barely putting it\\nin park long enough to hand the valet my keys.\\nBut this night, I was on time.\\nBruce Willis did not disappoint—he \\noozed\\n A-list. He didn’t just take over\\na room, he \\nwas\\n the room. In fact, I knew he was a real movie star when the\\nfirst thing he did was teach the bartender how to make a perfect vodka tonic.\\n“Three-second pour,” he said to the petrified man.\\nBruce was forty-four years old, single (separated from Demi Moore at the\\ntime I met him), and he knew the exact recipe for the perfect drink. He was a\\nparty; to be near him was invigorating. After a while, we were visited in our\\nprivate little room by Joe Pesci, whom Jonathan Lynn had directed in \\nMy\\nCousin Vinny,\\n as well as several attendant \\nattractive women. Bruce laughed\\nat all my dumb jokes—he seemed to enjoy the spectacle of a younger, funny\\nguy paying him his due respect and keeping up with his drinking (if he only\\nknew). I was thrilled to be around him because he knew how to live life.\\nDinner once again untouched, the two new best friends headed to his\\nmassive house off Mulholland—Bruce, too, seemed to like a view. The night\\nended with Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry, drinks in hand, hitting golf balls\\ninto the San Fernando Valley below.\\nThose balls are going to land somewhere,\\n I thought, and before I could\\nimagine the damage a shot from a well-addressed five iron could do, or even\\nthe metaphorical nature of what we were doing, I stopped thinking at all and\\nhad another drink.\\n“Welcome to the pros,” Bruce said at one point, referring, I presumed, to\\nthe life of a movie star, not to my golf game. We had begun a friendship, one\\nin which we drank together and made each other laugh and complimented\\neach other’s swings.\\nEventually, as always happens, the sun came up, and we said our bleary\\ngoodbyes. As I drove home, I remember thinking, \\nWatch this guy—this is the\\nway to be happy.\\n Nothing seemed to bother Bruce; no one said no to him.\\nThis was, indeed, the A-leagues.Around lunchtime that same day, Bruce called to invite me back to his\\nhouse for a screening of his next movie, but I was way too sick and hungover\\nto even contemplate showing up. Making my excuses, I asked him what the\\nmovie was called so I could catch it later.\\n“\\nThe Sixth Sense,\\n” he said.\\nSo, I’d gotten \\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n and had embarked on a friendship with\\nthe most famous movie star on the planet, but even I knew I was drinking\\nway too much to pull this movie off. Desperate measures \\nwould be needed.\\nSome might be able to party perfectly well and still show up and do the work\\n—but they were not addicts like I was.\\nIf I was going to keep up with the partying, and with Bruce, and not go\\nback to my hotel room and keep drinking, then I’d need something else to\\nwind me down and make sure I could get to set the next day.\\nI called a friend—I use the term loosely—who I knew sold Xanax.\\n“How many would you like to purchase?” he skeeved at me.\\n“Give me a hundred,” I said.\\nWhen they arrived, I sat on my bed, counting them. \\nThis way I can drink\\nwith Bruce and the others but then when I’m finally alone I can just pop one\\nof these and go to sleep.\\n I may have been a man with a plan, but I was also\\nignoring the fact that this was a completely lethal combination.\\nWe flew on Bruce’s plane (of course we did) to Montreal to make \\nThe\\nWhole Nine Yards,\\n arriving like conquering heroes ready to take the town by\\nstorm. I was the prodigal Canadian son, now returned, ready to party.\\nWe set up shop at the Intercontinental Hotel. I had a regular room; Bruce\\nhad the whole top floor, which he immediately dubbed “Club Z,” for no\\napparent reason. Within hours, he had also had a disco ball installed.\\nThe Globe Restaurant became our other home away from home. The\\nmoney and the drinks were flowing, and all the waitresses were hot.\\nMonths earlier, I had started dating a woman called Renee. I’d met her at\\na restaurant in Los Angeles called Red. I was having dinner with the first\\nassistant director of \\nFriends,\\n my pal Ben Weiss, and our waitress came and\\nsat down next to me and started chatting to me. This was not normal waitressbehavior, it seemed to me. When she had taken our order, I said to Ben, “Her\\nname is going to be Samantha.”\\n“Nah,” he said, “she’s definitely a Jennifer.”\\nWhen she came back with our food, I said, “We’re having a bet on \\nyour\\nname. I have money on Sam, and my friend here thinks you’re a Jen.”\\n“Hi,” she said, “I’m Renee.” And somehow, a few drunken parties later,\\nwe were a couple.\\nSuffice to say, Renee had substituted for someone who’d broken my heart\\non an earlier movie, which put her already behind the eight ball … by the\\ntime I went to Montreal, we were mostly on the outs, but in any case—and\\nI’m not proud to say this—I would have fucked mud at that stage in my life.\\nCanadian mud at that.\\nThe role itself was a snap. All I had to do was act scared of Bruce—which\\nwas easy—and act in love with Natasha Henstridge, which was even easier.\\nThe director, Jonathan, whom for some unknown reason I had taken to\\ncalling “Sammy,” ran the kind of set I love—a very creative one. The best\\njoke, no matter where it came from, would be picked, just like we did on\\nFriends\\n.\\nAmanda Peet was also in the cast. She was funny and smart and very\\nattractive, and even though she had a boyfriend, she didn’t mind flirting,\\nwhich she did at the drop of a hat with both Bruce and me, to the point where\\none day Bruce shouted at her, “\\nPick\\n one!”\\nAt night, the parties raged under Bruce’s disco ball in Club Z. Somehow,\\neveryone still managed to show up at 6:00 \\nA.M.\\n for work. I say “somehow,”\\nbut I know how I did: those hundred Xanax worked like a charm, though\\ncombined with my drinking they did tend to make my head resemble a\\nSpalding basketball. Meanwhile Mr. A-list Willis over there looked like he\\ncould open an envelope with his chin.\\nEach day, with me nursing a killer hangover, but young enough to deal,\\nwe would gather and look at the sides (TV- and movie-speak for the work\\nslated for the day). “We” was me, Jonathan Lynn, Bruce Willis, and the\\nhilarious Kevin Pollak, who was playing Janni Gogolak, \\nanother mob boss. Itwas almost like a writers’ room—we’d discuss what might be funny, what\\nmight go here in a scene, what might go there. A lot of the effort was to add\\nphysical comedy for me to do. I would run into windows, slam into doors. At\\none point I did a take in which I see a criminal, then turn, run into someone,\\nget knocked back, clatter into a lamp, pick the lamp up and try to shield\\nmyself from the baddie with it. All my idea, all worked great.\\nAt one point, Kevin had the line: “He shouldn’t be able to breathe the\\nair.”\\nI suggested to him that he insert an unnaturally long pause before the\\nwords “the air.” That was about the only time in my career where I could not\\nkeep it together—Kevin’s performance of that line was so funny, and the\\npause kept getting longer and longer with each take we did, that in the end he\\nhad to do his coverage with me in a different room.\\nWhen the veil of Bruce Willis was removed, I just wanted to be his friend. I\\ndidn’t want to be a suck-up to him like everybody else in the world. At one\\npoint when making \\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n we had a three-day weekend, and\\nhe flew me and Renee, and him and his girlfriend, to his house in the Turks\\nand Caicos. It’s a beautiful place with a stunning view of the ocean. They’d\\neven thought to buy out all the surrounding properties so that paparazzi\\ncouldn’t get their shots. All weekend we carried umbrellas with us to block\\nus from the sun so that our faces wouldn’t get too tanned and not match for\\nthe movie. A new movie star trick, one of many I learned from Mr. Willis.\\nBut there was a big difference between Bruce and me. Bruce was a\\npartier; I was an addict. Bruce has an on-off button. He can party like crazy,\\nthen get a script like \\nThe Sixth Sense\\n and stop the partying and nail the movie\\nsober. He doesn’t have the gene—he’s not an addict. \\nThere are plenty of\\nexamples of people in Hollywood who can party and still function—I was not\\none of them. When I was in my drinking and using days, if a police officer\\nwere to come to the door and say, “If you drink tonight, you’re going to jail\\ntomorrow,” I would start packing for jail, because once I start, I cannot stop.\\nAll I had control over was the first drink. After that, all bets were off. (See\\nunder: \\nThe man takes the drink, the drink takes all the rest.\\n) Once I believethe lie that I can just have one drink, I am no longer responsible for my\\nactions. I need people and treatment centers and hospitals and nurses to help\\nme.\\nI can’t stop. And if I didn’t get ahold of this soon, it was going to kill me.\\nI had a monster in my brain, a monster who wanted to get me alone, and\\nconvince me to have that first drink or pill, and then that monster would\\nengulf me.\\nDespite the partying, we were all pros on that movie and managed to turn out\\na huge crowd pleaser. Early notices for it were positive—one, in \\nVariety\\nmagazine, read:\\nBruce Willis will deliver the customers, but it’s Matthew Perry who\\nwill attract the most attention in a pratfall-filled turn that bears\\ncomparison to what Tom Hanks was doing 12–15 years ago.\\nThis was high praise indeed for someone who looked up to Tom. Bruce\\nhadn’t been sure the film would work at all, and I’d bet him it would—if he\\nlost, he had to do a guest spot on \\nFriends\\n (he’s in three episodes of season\\nsix).\\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n became the number one movie in America for\\nthree weeks straight.\\nI had done it—the dream I’d had since the ninth grade had finally come\\ntrue: \\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n was no \\nBack to the Future,\\n but \\nMichael J. Fox\\nand I are the only two people who have had the number one movie and the\\nnumber one TV show at the same time.\\nI should have been the toast of the town, but back in LA, it was clear, at\\nleast to me, that my addiction had progressed to dangerous levels. I was at the\\npoint where I was basically unable to leave the house—drugs and alcohol had\\ncompletely taken over. I was so strung out on drugs and dealing with drug\\ndealers that I couldn’t actually leave my bedroom—instead of a grand\\nmoment of pure fame, dealing with dealers was all I was doing. I showed up\\nto the premiere of the movie, of course, and put on \\nThe Matthew Perry Show,but I was bloated and driven by fear of something that I did not understand.\\nI’ve always had a dream of going on a talk show and being honest.\\nJay Leno: \\nSo, how you doing, Matthew?\\nMe: \\nMan, I just don’t know which way is up. I am totally screwed. I am so\\nmiserable. I can’t get out of bed.\\nThis would have been the perfect time for that.\\nFour years after \\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n Bruce and I and Kevin shot a sequel\\n(different director this time). If \\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n was the start of my\\nmovie stardom, it’s fair to say that \\nThe Whole Ten Yards\\n was the end.\\nWe shot that second movie in Los Angeles—we were given all too much\\nfreedom and it sucked. You can seldom re-create a good thing, and it was\\ntrue here; the jokes felt stale, the parties even staler. In fact, it was so bad that\\na while later, I called my agents and said, “I’m still allowed to \\ngo\\n to movies\\nthough, right?”\\nWhen \\nThe Whole Nine Yards\\n came out I had been so mired in addiction I\\ncould barely leave my room. I had been in a hellhole of despair and\\ndemoralization, and my fucked-up mind was slowly dragging my body down\\nwith it. Recently it struck me: this type of feeling should have been reserved\\nfor when \\nThe Whole Ten Yards\\n came out. Anyone in their right mind would\\nhave been beyond depressed after that one.\\nSometimes, at the end of the night, when the sun was just about to come up\\nand everyone else had gone, and the party was over, Bruce and I would just\\nsit and talk. That’s when I saw the real Bruce Willis—a good-hearted man, a\\ncaring man, selfless. A wonderful parent. And a wonderful actor. And most\\nimportant, a good guy. And if he wanted me to be, I would be his friend for\\nlife. But as is the way with so many of these things, our paths rarely crossed\\nafter that.\\nI, of course, pray for him every night now.INTERLUDE\\nAll Heaven Breaking Loose\\nSomething happened, and I relapsed. As I’ve said, to relapse that’s all it\\ntakes: something—anything at all—happening. Good or bad.\\nI was blowing yet another stretch of sobriety. I don’t even remember\\nwhy. I had been thriving. I’d had two years—I was helping other men get\\nsober and I blew it all over something so minute I can’t even remember what\\nit was. What I do remember is there was lots of drinking, lots of drugs, lots of\\nisolation. I always used alone—I was afraid that if anyone saw how much I\\nwas doing, they would be horrified and try to get me to stop. But I had\\nalready started, so stopping was not an option.\\nSomething that has often saved my life is that I get scared. When I think\\nthings have gotten too out of control, I panic, pick up the phone, and ask for\\nhelp. That time, a sober companion and my wonderful father came to the\\nrescue. They moved in immediately; I started to detox off the drugs that very\\nday.\\nI felt physically completely ruined … but the detox was going well. At\\nleast that’s what my dad and the sober companion thought. What they didn’t\\nknow was that I had hidden a bottle of Xanax in my bedroom. This is what\\nit’s like to be an addict: you do things you never \\ndreamed you would do. My\\nwonderful father had dropped everything to move in, to love and support me\\nthrough one more self-created disaster, and I paid him back by hiding drugs\\nin my nightstand.\\nOne night I was desperate for sleep, any kind of escape from the brutal\\ndetox I was going through. That bottle of Xanax was calling to me, an evil\\nbeacon in the darkness. I thought of it like a lighthouse, only in this case, Iturned my boat toward the wrecking rocks, not away from them. The\\nchildproof bottle cap was no obstacle for this child; in the other room, that\\nchild’s father dozed, watching reruns of \\nTaxi,\\n while in my room by the\\nmetaphorical lethal cliffs, I dove into that bottle of Xanax and took four. (One\\nwas too many. But \\nfour?\\n)\\nIt didn’t work. No escape came—those four Xanax proved no match for\\nmy racing thoughts. Sleep remained elusive. It was being held back by shame\\nand fear and an intense self-loathing. So, what’s the logical next move? Well\\nfor this drug addict, it was to take four more. (This wasn’t just eight too many\\n—this is a death-defying amount.) Somehow, these second four combined\\nwith the first four, and I finally managed to fall asleep. The sleep on Xanax\\nisn’t profound—the drug is notoriously shit at providing deep sleep—but I\\ndidn’t care. I just wanted this brain of mine, this thing that stalked me, to\\nquieten just for a few hours at least … and some relief from the incredibly\\npainful detox I was going through.\\nI was fortunate enough to wake up, but the Xanax had done something\\nworse than preventing deep sleep—it had fried my brain and made me insane.\\nI was seeing things: strange visions and colors I’d never seen before, colors I\\ndidn’t know could exist. The gray automated drapes in my bedroom had\\nturned into a deep purple color. It was as if the rods and cones in my retina\\nwere sending new and unbidden messages through my optic nerve to my\\nalready barbecued brain stem. Regular blues were cerulean, now; reds were\\nmagentas; black was Vantablack or Black 3.0, the blackest of blacks.\\nNot only that, but I had run out of Xanax, and if something was not done\\nquickly about that, I could die. (Remember: booze and Xanax are the only\\ndetoxes that can kill you—an opiate detox just makes you wish you were\\ndead.) But I was coming off all of them. My only option was to somehow get\\nmore Xanax, but the setup in my house didn’t allow for that. I would surely\\nget caught. So, I would have to come clean about the fact that I had been\\ntaking it so I could get properly detoxed from it, too.\\nI left my bedroom and into a kaleidoscope of color of my living room. \\nIs\\nthis heaven?\\n I thought. \\nDid the Xanax kill me last night and this is what\\nheaven is like?\\n I gently explained to my dad and the sober companion what I\\nhad done. They were both appropriately terrified. The sober companionleaped into action and called a doctor.\\nI was completely out of my mind. It was then that I decided to share with\\nmy father a fear I was having.\\n“Dad,” I said, deadly serious, “I know this is going to sound crazy, but at\\nany moment, a giant snake is going to come and take me away.”\\nMy father’s reaction?\\n“Matty, if a giant snake comes and takes you away, I will shit my pants.”\\nTo this day I am impressed by how my father rolled with my utter insanity.\\nAt this point, the sober companion returned to the room, expressed his\\ndisappointment, but said he was still willing to help me out. But I needed to\\nsee a doctor right away. We headed off to see him. At the end of the\\nconsultation, I apologized to the doctor, shook his hand, and promised it\\nwould never happen again. And I meant it—I was done. The doctor ordered\\nnew detox meds, antiseizure medication (detoxing from Xanax can cause\\nseizures). We headed home. My long-suffering assistant, Moira, was called to\\npick up said medication, and we waited. And waited. For some reason, it took\\nher hours to complete this new mission.\\nThe clock was ticking, though. If I didn’t get this detox medication soon,\\nsome serious shit was going to go down. I could have a seizure; I could die.\\nNeither option sounded good to me. Now, three grown men were staring at\\nthe front door, waiting for it to open, and two of those men were also staring\\nat scared Matty.\\nAfter a while, I couldn’t bear the scrutiny and removed myself to a small\\ncouch to the side of the kitchen. Reality, that acquired taste, was beginning to\\nreassert itself, slowly, surely, like a lens focusing. And I felt absolutely\\nhorrible, both physically and emotionally. I was riddled with shame and guilt.\\nI could not believe I had done this one more time. The men I was sponsoring\\nhad more sober time than I did. You can’t give away what you don’t have.\\nAnd I had nothing.\\nI hated myself.\\nThis was a new bottom; I didn’t think you could get any lower than my\\nprevious bottom, but I had managed to do it. And all of this in front of my\\nfather, who was obviously terrified. The cunning, baffling, powerful nature of\\naddiction had gotten me one more time.The front door still wasn’t opening. This was serious trouble. I was a\\ndesperate man. The drugs were in full flow, the drinking, too. Things were so\\nbad I couldn’t even cry. To cry might have signaled that there was at least a\\nsemblance of the normal somewhere abouts, but there was nothing natural\\nabout any of this.\\nSo, a bottom—the lowest point of my life. This is a classic moment for an\\naddict, a moment after which one seeks lasting help.… But hey, what’s this\\nnow? As I sat there looking into the kitchen, I noticed a crinkle in the\\natmosphere. Perhaps someone not at their bottom might have waved it away\\nas nothing, but to me it was so compelling that I couldn’t look away. It\\nresembled a kind of little wave in the air. I had never seen anything like it\\nbefore in my life. It was real, true, tangible, concrete. Is this what you see at\\nthe end? Was I dying? And then …\\nI frantically began to pray—with the desperation of a drowning \\nman. The\\nlast time I’d prayed, right before I’d gotten \\nFriends,\\n I’d managed only to\\nstrike a Faustian bargain with a God who had simply drawn a long breath and\\nbided his damn time. Here I was, more than a decade later, chancing my\\npraying arm once again.\\n“God, please help me,” I whispered. “Show me that you are here. God,\\nplease help me.”\\nAs I prayed, the little wave in the air transformed into a small, golden\\nlight. As I kneeled, the light slowly began to get bigger, and bigger, until it\\nwas so big that it encompassed the entire room. It was like I was standing on\\nthe sun. I had stepped on the surface of the sun. What was happening? And\\nwhy was I starting to feel better? And why was I not terrified? The light\\nengendered a feeling more perfect than the most perfect quantity of drugs I\\nhad ever taken. Feeling euphoric now, I did get scared and tried to shake it\\noff. But there was no shaking this off. It was way way bigger than me. My\\nonly choice was to surrender to it, which was not hard, because it felt so\\ngood. The euphoria had begun at the top of my head and slowly seeped down\\nthroughout my entire body—I must have sat there for five, six, seven\\nminutes, filled with it.\\nMy blood hadn’t been replaced with warm honey. I \\nwas\\n warm honey.\\nAnd for the first time in my life, I was in the presence of love and acceptanceand filled with an overwhelming feeling that everything was going to be OK.\\nI knew now that my prayer had been answered. I was in the presence of God.\\nBill Wilson, who created AA, was saved by a lightning-bolt-through-the-\\nwindow experience where he felt he was meeting God.\\nThis was mine.\\nBut, feeling this good was terrifying. I was once asked if I’d ever been\\nhappy, and I almost bit that fucker’s head off. (At Promises once, during a\\nrehab, I’d told my counselor that I was freaked-out by how happy everyone\\nrecovering seemed. “They’re like a bunch of happy people living on a hill\\nwhile I’m dying,” I’d said, and he’d explained to \\nme that a lot of those people\\nweren’t getting it and didn’t understand what was going on and would\\neventually be back in rehab and things would be even worse for them next\\ntime around.)\\nAfter about seven minutes (insert “seven minutes in heaven” joke here)\\nthe light began to dim. The euphoria died down. God had done his work and\\nwas off helping someone else now.\\nI started to cry. I mean, I really started to cry—that shoulder-shaking kind\\nof uncontrollable weeping. I wasn’t crying because I was sad. I was crying\\nbecause for the first time in my life, I felt OK. I felt safe, taken care of.\\nDecades of struggling with God, and wresting with life, and sadness, all was\\nbeing washed away, like a river of pain gone into oblivion.\\nI had been in the presence of God. I was certain of it. And this time I had\\nprayed for the right thing: help.\\nEventually the weeping subsided. But everything was different now. I\\ncould see color differently, angles were of a different magnitude, the walls\\nwere stronger, the ceiling higher, the trees tapping on the windows more\\nperfect than ever, their roots connected via the soil to the planet and back into\\nme—one great connection created by an ever-loving God—and beyond, a\\nsky, which had before been theoretically infinite was now unknowably\\nendless. I was connected to the universe in a way I had never been. Even the\\nplants in my house, which I had never even noticed before, seemed in sharp\\nfocus, more lovely than it was possible to be, more perfect, more alive.\\nI stayed sober for two years based solely on that moment. God had shown\\nme a sliver of what life could be. He had saved me that day, and for all days,no matter what. He had turned me into a seeker, not only of sobriety, and\\ntruth, but also of him. He had opened a window, and closed it, as if to say,\\n“Now go earn this.”\\nNowadays, when a particular darkness hits me, I find myself wondering if\\nit was just Xanax insanity, a continuation of the snake I had \\nbeen sure was\\nabout to show up—the drug can cause what the National Institutes of Health\\ndescribe as “reversible brief psychotic episodes.” (I later had a gigantic\\nseizure in front of my father, too, which wasn’t the most fun I’ve ever had—\\nnor was being rushed to UCLA Medical Center, which at the time I thought\\nwas an angel way station.) But quickly I return to the truth of the golden\\nlight. When I am sober, I can still see it, remember what it did for me. Some\\nmight write it off as a near-death experience, but I was there, and it was God.\\nAnd when I am connected, God shows me that it was real, little hints like\\nwhen the sunlight hits the ocean and turns it into that beautiful golden color.\\nOr the reflection of sunlight on the green leaves of a tree, or when I see the\\nlight return to someone’s eyes when they come out of the darkness into\\nsobriety. And I feel it when I help someone get sober, the way it hits my heart\\nwhen they say thank you. Because they don’t know yet that I should really be\\nthanking them.\\nA year later I met a woman I’d stay with for six years. God is everywhere\\n—you just have to clear your channel, or you’ll miss it.7\\nThe Benefit of Friends\\nMonica went first; she placed her key on the empty counter. Chandler went\\nnext. Then Joey—big laugh as he really shouldn’t have even had a key—then\\nRoss, then Rachel, and last of all Phoebe. Now, there were six keys on the\\ncountertop, and what do you say after that?\\nWe all stood in one long line. Phoebe said, “I guess this is it,” and Joey\\nsaid, “Yeah,” then almost broke the fourth wall by looking out at the\\naudience briefly before saying, “I guess so.…”\\nBut there was no fourth wall to break; there never had been, in fact. We\\nhad been in people’s bedrooms and living rooms for a decade; in the end, we\\nwere an integral part of so many people’s lives that what we’d missed was\\nthat there had never been a fourth wall to break in the first place. We’d just\\nbeen six close friends in an apartment that was seemingly way too big, when\\nin fact it was just the size of a TV set in a living room.\\nAnd then it was time to leave that apartment one last time. Now, though,\\nthere were eight of us—the six main characters, plus Monica and Chandler’s\\ntwins in a stroller.\\nBefore that final episode, I’d taken Marta Kauffman to one side.\\n“Nobody else will care about this except me,” I said. “So, may I \\nplease\\nhave the last line?” That’s why as we all troop out of the apartment, and\\nRachel has suggested one last coffee, I got to bring the curtain down on\\nFriends.\\n“Sure,” Chandler said, and then, with perfect timing, for the very last\\ntime, “\\nWhere?\\n”\\nI love the look on Schwimmer’s face as I deliver that line—it’s theperfect mixture of affection and amusement, exactly what the show \\nFriends\\nhad always given to the world.\\nAnd with that, it was over.\\nThe truth was, we were all ready for \\nFriends\\n to be done. For a start,\\nJennifer Aniston had decided that she didn’t want to do the show anymore,\\nand as we all made decisions as a group, that meant we all had to stop.\\nJennifer wanted to do movies; I had been doing movies all that time and had\\nThe Whole Ten Yards\\n about to come out, which was sure to be a hit (insert\\ndonkey’s head now), but in any case, even though it had been the greatest job\\nin the world, the stories of Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe\\nhad all pretty much played out by 2004. It was not lost on me that Chandler\\nhad grown up way faster than I had. As a result, mostly by Jenny’s design,\\nten was a shortened season. But all the characters were basically happy by\\nthis point, too, and no one wants to watch a bunch of happy people doing\\nhappy things—what’s funny about that?\\nIt was January 23, 2004. The keys on the counter, a guy who looked a lot\\nlike Chandler Bing said, “\\nWhere?\\n,” “Embryonic Journey” by Jefferson\\nAirplane played, the camera panned to the back of the apartment door, then\\nBen, our first AD, and very close friend, shouted for the last time, “That’s a\\nwrap,” and tears sprang from almost everyone’s eyes like so many geysers.\\nWe had made 237 episodes, including this last one, called, appropriately\\nenough, “The Last One.” Aniston was \\nsobbing\\n—after a while, I was amazed\\nshe had any water left in her entire body. Even Matt LeBlanc was crying. But\\nI felt nothing; I couldn’t tell if \\nthat was because of the opioid buprenorphine I\\nwas taking, or if I was just generally dead inside. (Buprenorphine, for the\\nrecord, is a detox med, and an excellent one, and is designed to help you stay\\noff other “stronger” opiates—it does not \\nalter\\n you in any way. But, ironically,\\nit’s the hardest drug to come off in the entire world. Bupe, or Suboxone,\\nshould never be used for more than seven days. Fearing a nasty detox, I had\\nbeen on it for eight months.)\\nSo, instead of sobbing, I took a slow walk around the stage with my then-\\ngirlfriend—also appropriately called Rachel—stage 24 at Warner Bros. in\\nBurbank (a stage that after the show ended would be renamed “The Friends\\nStage”). We said our various goodbyes, agreeing to see each other soon in theway that people do when they know it’s not true, and then we headed out to\\nmy car.\\nI sat in the lot for a moment and thought about the previous ten years. I\\nthought about \\nL.A.X. 2194\\n and the $22,500 and Craig Bierko; I thought about\\nhow I’d been the last one cast, and that trip to Vegas, where we could walk\\nthrough a packed casino, and no one knew who we were. I thought about all\\nthe gags and the double takes, the Murray brothers, and some of my most\\nfamous/too-close-to-the-truth lines, like, “Hi, I’m Chandler, I make jokes\\nwhen I’m uncomfortable,” and “Until I was twenty-five, I thought that the\\nonly response to ‘I love you’ was ‘Oh, crap!’” and “We swallow our feelings.\\nEven if it means we’re unhappy forever,” and “Could she \\nbe\\n more out of my\\nleague?”\\nI thought about the summer between seasons eight and nine, when I’d\\nspent time in rehab, and \\nPeople\\n magazine had said on its cover that I was\\n“Happy, Healthy, and HOT!” (“\\nFriends\\n funny guy talks about those dating\\nrumors,” the lede read, “the ‘final’ season, and his battle to get sober. ‘It was\\nscary,’ he says. ‘I didn’t want to die.’”) I had indeed spent that summer\\ngetting sober and playing a lot of tennis. I thought about the first day of\\nseason four, after the summer that I had very publicly gone to rehab. At the\\nfirst table read obviously all eyes were on me. My \\npal Kevin Bright, one of\\nthe shows executive producers, had opened the proceedings by saying,\\n“Anyone want to talk about their summer vacations?” and I took the\\nopportunity to break the ice, saying rather loudly and soberly, “OK! I’ll\\nstart!” thus releasing all the tension in the room. Everyone erupted in laughter\\nand applause for me for turning my life around and showing up looking good\\nand ready to work. Probably to this day, it was the smartest joke I have ever\\nmade.\\nI thought about how I’d had to beg the producers to let me no longer\\nspeak like Chandler for the final few seasons (not to mention getting rid of\\nthose sweater vests). That particular cadence—could it \\nbe\\n more annoying?—\\nhad been so played out that if I had to put the emphasis in the wrong place\\none more time, I thought I’d explode, so I just went back to saying lines\\nnormally, for the most part in season six and then beyond.\\nI thought about me crying when I asked Monica to marry me.And me being me, there were negative thoughts, too.\\nWhat will become of me now that I no longer have this insanely fun,\\ncreative job to go to every day?\\nFriends\\n had been a safe place, a touchstone of calm for me; it had given\\nme a reason to get out of bed every morning, and it had also given me a\\nreason to take it just a little bit easier the night before. It was the time of our\\nlives. It was like we got some new piece of amazing news every day. Even I\\nknew only a madman (which in many moments I had been nonetheless)\\nwould screw up a job like that.\\nAs we drove home that night, along Sunset I pointed out to Rachel a\\nmassive billboard promoting \\nThe Whole Ten Yards\\n. There I was, fifty feet\\nhigh, frowning in a dark suit and purple shirt and tie, standing next to Bruce\\nWillis, he dressed in white T-shirt, pinafore, and bunny slippers. WILLIS …\\nPERRY, it read, in six-foot letters, above the tagline: \\nTHEY MISSED EACH\\nOTHER. THIS TIME, THEIR AIM IS BETTER.\\n I was a movie star. (You remember\\nwhat I said about the donkey’s head, right?)\\nMy future, even without \\nFriends,\\n looked rosy enough, though. I had a\\nmajor movie coming out; I’d done two episodes of \\nAlly McBeal\\n and three of\\nThe West Wing,\\n so I was developing serious acting chops as well as the\\ncomedy stuff (I’d gotten two Emmy nominations for my three \\nThe West Wing\\nappearances). I’d also just finished wrapping a TNT movie called \\nThe Ron\\nClark Story,\\n about a real-life small-town teacher who gets a job in one of the\\ntoughest schools in Harlem. There wasn’t a single joke in the whole thing—it\\ndrove me crazy how serious it was—so off camera I created a character\\ncalled “Ron Dark” who was drunk and who constantly swore in front of the\\nchildren. Despite that, it was a big hit when it eventually aired in August\\n2006. I would garner nominations for a SAG award, a Golden Globe, and an\\nEmmy. (I lost all three to Robert Duvall. I couldn’t believe it—being beaten\\nout by such a hack.)\\nBut as I’ve said, \\nThe Whole Ten Yards\\n would prove to be a disaster—I’m\\nnot sure even my closest family and friends went to see it. In fact, if you\\nlooked closely enough, you could see people averting their eyes from the\\nscreen at the premiere. I think it actually got a zero rating on Rotten\\nTomatoes.And that was the moment Hollywood decided to no longer invite Mr.\\nPerry to be in movies.\\nI had made arrangements to attend a 12-step meeting the day after the final\\ntaping of \\nFriends,\\n with the express intent of starting my new life on the right\\npath. But facing the blank canvas of an empty day was very hard on me. That\\nnext morning, I woke up and thought, \\nWhat the fuck am I going to do now?\\nWhat the fuck could I do? I was hooked on Bupe, with no new job in\\nsight. Which was ridiculous, given that I’d just finished making the most\\nbeloved sitcom in TV history. On top of that, my relationship \\nwith Rachel\\nwas getting rocky—the physical distance was an issue, as was the emotional\\ncloseness. I was damned if I did, damned when I didn’t.\\nAnd then I was single once again.\\nWith no ridiculously high paying, dream-come-true kind of job to go to,\\nand no special someone in my life, things slipped fast—in fact, it was like\\nfalling off a cliff. The insanity of using other, stronger drugs crept up into my\\ndiseased brain once again. It wasn’t long before the seemingly impossible\\nhappened again. I started drinking and using.\\nDespite how it may appear, I was never suicidal, thank God—I never\\nactually wanted to die. In fact, in the back of my mind I always had some\\nsemblance of hope. But, if dying was a consequence of getting to take the\\nquantity of drugs I needed, then death was something I was going to have to\\naccept. That’s how skewed my thinking had become—I was able to hold\\nthose two things in my mind at the same time: I don’t want to die, but if I\\nhave to in order to get sufficient drugs on board, then amen to oblivion. I can\\ndistinctively remember holding pills in my hand and thinking, \\nThis could kill\\nme,\\n and taking them anyway.\\nThis is a very fine, and very scary, line. I had reached a point in my\\ndrinking and using where I was drinking and using to forget about how much\\nI was drinking and using. And it took an almost lethal amount to accomplish\\nthat kind of amnesia.\\nI was also so lonely that it hurt; I could feel the loneliness in my bones.\\nOn the outside, I looked like the luckiest man alive, so there were only a fewpeople I could complain to without being told to shut up, and even then …\\nnothing could fill the hole inside me. At one point I bought yet another new\\ncar, the excitement of which lasted about five days. I moved regularly, too—\\nthe thrill of a new house with an even better view lasted a bit longer than the\\nPorsche or the Bentley, but not by much. I was also so introspective that a\\nproper give-and-take \\nrelationship with a woman was nigh on impossible; I\\nwas much better at friends with benefits, so that whoever I was seeing didn’t\\ndiscover that slow, creeping thought that I was irredeemably not enough.\\nI was lost. There was nowhere to turn. Everywhere I tried to hide, there I\\nwas. Alcoholics hate two things: the way things are and change. I knew\\nsomething had to change—I wasn’t suicidal, but I was dying—but I was too\\nscared to do anything about it.\\nI was a man in need of a yellow light experience, so I was eternally\\ngrateful that it had happened that day in my house, because it gave me a new\\nlease on life. I had been given the gift of sobriety one more time. The only\\nquestion was: What was I going to do with it? Nothing had worked long-term\\nbefore. I was going to have to approach everything differently, or I was a\\ngoner. And I didn’t want to be a goner. Not before I had learned to live, to\\nlove. Not before the world made more sense to me.\\nHad my habit killed me, it would have killed the wrong person. I wasn’t\\nfully me yet; I was just parts of me (and not the best parts, either). My new\\napproach to life would have to start with work, because that seemed to be the\\neasiest place to start. Embracing effort was the only hope for me. I built up\\nsome sober time, was back on my feet once again. I also had a few friends-\\nwith-benefits things going on, but one was starting to slowly morph into\\nsomething more. Maybe \\nmuch\\n more. I knew how to do friends with benefits\\n—but this? This I was less clear about. I started to want her to stay \\npast the\\nsex\\n: “Why don’t you stick around and we can watch a movie?”\\nWhat was I doing? I was breaking all the rules.\\nShe was twenty-three and I was thirty-six when we first met. In fact, I knew\\nshe was twenty-three because I’d crashed her twenty-third birthday party.\\nOur subsequent initial make-out session was in the back of \\na really messyToyota (to think I’d spent all that money on fancy cars and here I was in the\\nbackseat of a tan Corolla). When we were done, I said, “I’m getting out of the\\ncar now. Mostly because I’m thirty-six.”\\nSo began two years of probably record-breaking amounts of sexual\\nintercourse, with no strings attached, both of us following the friends-with-\\nbenefits rules to a tee. We were on the same page. We never went to dinner,\\nwe never talked about each other’s families. We never discussed what went\\non in each other’s lives regarding other people. Instead, it was texting, and\\nsaying things like, “How about Thursday night at seven?”\\nShe was tough at first. I remember an exchange early on where I told her\\nI was wearing a suit and thought I looked pretty good.\\n“I hate suits,” she said.\\nI broke her out of her toughness, but it took years.\\nSomewhere it is written in the actor’s handbook—actually, it’s probably in\\nthe book my dad gave me, the one he’d inscribed with “another generation\\nshot to hell”—that you have to try to do new things and stretch yourself. If\\nyou have excelled at comedy, then it behooves you to make a direct right turn\\nand become a dramatic actor. So that became the plan. I couldn’t retire, and\\nthere was only so much time a grown man could spend playing video games.\\nAs my friends-with-benefits partner said to me one day, “You live the life of\\nsomeone who drinks and uses, you just don’t drink and use.” (She was really\\nsmart, too—did I mention that?)\\nI was at a crossroads. What do you do when you are an actor, and you are\\nrich and famous, but you are not interested in being rich and famous?\\nWell, you either retire (way too young for that), or you change it up.\\nI informed my manager and agents that I was now looking only for\\ndramatic work.\\nI had dabbled in it with good results on \\nThe West Wing\\n and \\nAlly McBeal\\nand \\nThe Ron Clark Story,\\n so it didn’t seem like a crazy move. I auditioned for\\nsome serious films, but I didn’t get any of them. I shot a few indie movies\\nthat tried hard, but that didn’t work out, either.\\nAnd then, a script came along that was white-hot.I had never seen so much heat attached to a project—it was magnetic.\\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip,\\n written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by\\nThomas Schlamme, was the follow-up to their little show called \\nThe West\\nWing.\\n Between them they had like fifteen Emmys, so their new project\\ncaused a frenzy in the fall of 2005 unlike anything else. I had never seen a\\nproject that had so much power behind it before it had even started. NBC and\\nCBS went at it like gladiators to get that thing, with NBC ultimately winning\\nout to the tune of something like $3 million per episode. All that fall,\\nwherever I turned, someone was talking about \\nStudio 7 on the Sunset Strip\\n(its original name). I was in New York finishing up \\nThe Ron Clark Story\\n and\\nstaying at my favorite hotel in the world, the Greenwich, in Tribeca. I really\\nwanted to read this hot script. Because I was on the East Coast, the script\\nwould not get to my hotel until 10:00 \\nP.M.,\\n so I waited up.\\nAaron and Tommy had changed the way America looked at serialized TV\\nwith \\nThe West Wing,\\n and I had changed how America spoke English via the\\ncadences of Chandler Bing. Seemed like a potent combination.\\nBy 11:30 \\nP.M\\n. I had read the script and decided to return to network\\ntelevision.\\nThe lead characters were Matt Albie, the head writer of Studio 7 (and a\\nrole that apparently Aaron had written with me in mind), and Danny Tripp,\\nhis fellow showrunner, to be played by the kind and brilliant Bradley\\nWhitford, both being brought back to save an \\nSNL\\n-like show called \\nStudio 60\\non the Sunset Strip.\\nBefore a lick of it was filmed, it had “giant, Emmy-winning hit” \\nwritten\\nall over it. It had Sorkin, Schlamme, and me. What could possibly go wrong?\\nThe first problem was the money. I’d been making a tremendous nut on\\nFriends\\n and realized I’d struggle to get that number again, but even so, the\\nfact that everyone in this ensemble show about a comedy TV program was\\nbeing asked to accept the same fee.… The conversation went something like\\nthis (think of this in Sorkin-speak):\\nMe: \\nI really want to do this.\\nManager: \\nWell, no one does this kind of thing better than Sorkin.\\nMe: \\nThis would be my return to television—it’s the way to go.Manager: \\nThe only problem is the offer.\\nMe: \\nThe offer? What is it?\\nManager: \\nThe offer’s what you get per episode.…\\nMe: \\nI know that. Thank you. I meant, what’s the number?\\nManager: \\n$50,000 per episode.\\nMe: \\nI got more than a million per for\\n Friends. \\nCan’t we get them up?\\nManager: \\nIt doesn’t look like it. They want this to be a true ensemble\\nshow and that is what they are offering everyone.\\nMe: \\nI can’t believe I have to turn down the best television script I have\\never read.\\nMy manager, God bless him, didn’t give up. He pointed out to the\\nproducers that even though \\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip\\n had indeed been\\nconceived as an ensemble show, as soon as I stepped onstage it was going to\\nbe about my character, which is what ended up happening. With that\\nargument in mind, after about six weeks of negotiations, we got them off\\ntheir ensemble idea. I was to be billed as the star of the show, and we got\\nthem up to $175,000. Now, obviously that is an amazing amount of money to\\nbe paid a week, but three stages down, LeBlanc was being paid $600,000 a\\nweek to do \\nJoey\\n. But in the end, the writing \\nprevailed (every actor is just\\nlooking for good material), and I accepted the lowball number (and they hired\\nmy good friend Amanda Peet to round out the cast).\\nWe shot the pilot, and I would hold up that pilot up against any pilot I had\\never seen—it was that good. There was an energy to it, a crackle that’s rare in\\nTV, and fans loved it, too. It opened huge. (All my shows after \\nFriends\\nopened huge and then suddenly they weren’t anymore.) The second episode\\nof \\nStudio 60\\n drew literally half the number of people that the first one did. No\\none cared about the show. It took me years to figure out why.\\nThere was a fatal flaw to \\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip,\\n one that no\\namount of good writing or good direction or good acting could fix. On \\nThe\\nWest Wing,\\n the stakes were as high as you could imagine: a nuclear bomb is\\npointing at Ohio and the president has to fix that shit? People in Ohio would\\ntune in to a show like that just to find out exactly what might happen if they\\nwere invited to kiss their own asses goodbye by an incoming intercontinentalballistic missile.\\nA very small group of people—myself included—know that for a sector\\nof show business, getting a joke right is a matter of life and death. These are\\nbent, weird people. But people in Canton, Ohio, watching \\nStudio 60 on the\\nSunset Strip\\n probably thought, \\nIt’s just a joke, why doesn’t everybody calm\\ndown. It’s not that big a deal, what is wrong with all of you people?\\n This was\\nnot the Monty Python bit about Ernest Scribbler who wrote a joke so funny it\\nkilled Nazis. (The Brits are immune to its power because they don’t speak\\nGerman. And the actual German of the killer joke is gibberish, which is also\\nfunny.) There might have been a devoted set of viewers in Rock Center or\\nworking the door of the Comedy Store on Sunset, but outside of that, the\\nbasic premise of the show didn’t reach the levels of edge-of-the-seat stakes.\\nTrying to attach \\nThe West Wing\\n stakes to a comedy show could never work.\\nOn a granular level, I also found the \\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip\\n \\nwork\\nenvironment to be frustratingly unlike that of \\nFriends,\\n or even \\nThe Whole\\nNine Yards\\n. Aaron runs a very tight ship—that’s just how he likes it—to the\\npoint where there was someone on set with a script making sure that if the\\noriginal reads “he is angry” and I, or someone else, shortened it to “\\nhe’s\\nangry,” we’d have to reshoot the entire scene—it had to be done \\nexactly as\\nwritten\\n. (I nicknamed the production assistant whose job this was “the\\nHawk,” and honestly, what a horrible gig she had, having to be a hall monitor\\nto a bunch of creative types acting their balls off.) Unfortunately, sometimes\\na take with a slightly different rendering of the line had been the best take of\\nall, but still, the one that got used was the word-perfect one, not the \\nbest\\n one.\\nThe Aaron Sorkin as writer / Tommy Schlamme as director system was never\\nreally actor centered, therefore it was much more about getting the text right,\\nas though it were Shakespeare—in fact, I heard someone say on set that this\\nwas\\n Shakespeare.…\\nI also had a different view of the creative process generally—I was used\\nto pitching ideas, but Aaron didn’t take any of them. I had thoughts, too,\\nabout the arc of my character, but they weren’t welcomed, either. Problem is,\\nI’m not just a talking head. I have a brain, especially comedically. Aaron\\nSorkin is a much better writer than I am, but he’s not a funnier man than me\\n(he’d kindly once said that \\nFriends\\n was his favorite show). And in \\nStudio 60\\n Iwas playing a \\ncomedy\\n writer. I thought I had some funny ideas, but Aaron\\nsaid no to 100 percent of them. That’s his right, and it’s no knock on him that\\nhe likes to run his set this way. It just left me disappointed. (Tom Hanks told\\nme that Aaron did the same thing to him.)\\nI guess I was lucky that I’d already learned that being on a successful TV\\nshow didn’t fix anything. The show went out the gate gangbusters, the pilot\\npulling down a cool thirteen million viewers and a fourteen share, which was\\nsolid. The reviews were positive, too. \\nVariety\\n said, “It’s hard not to root for\\nStudio 60 on the Sunset Strip,\\n a series that \\nweds Aaron Sorkin’s crackling\\ndialogue and willingness to tackle big ideas with a beyond-stellar cast.” The\\nChicago Tribune\\n went even further, writing me a love letter and saying,\\n“\\nStudio 60\\n is not just good, it has the potential to be a small-screen classic.”\\nBut the problem remained: it was trying to be a serious show about\\ncomedy and quality TV, as though those two things were as important as\\nworld politics. I recently read one really instructive critique about \\nStudio 60\\non the \\nOnion\\n’s A.V. Club vertical. Its author, Nathan Rabin, writing a few\\nyears after the show aired, agrees that the pilot was a special piece of work.\\nAlong with much of the public, I watched the pilot in a state of\\nfeverish anticipation the night it premièred on September 18, 2006.\\nWhen it was over, I couldn’t wait to see what happened next. I re-\\nwatched it … a few months back [and] what I responded to most\\nprofoundly upon a repeat viewing was its infinite sense of possibility.\\nStudio 60\\n could go anywhere. It could do anything. And it could do it\\nwith one of the most remarkable casts in recent memory. The pilot for\\nStudio 60\\n still radiates potential the second time around, even if it was\\ndoomed to go fatally unrealized.\\nBut Rabin also points out that the show probably took itself too seriously,\\ngiven that it was supposed to be about gags, and that Sorkin’s absolute\\ncontrol of the show left no room for anyone else to breathe.\\nThe show’s arrogance extended to having Aaron Sorkin write every\\nepisode. Oh sure, staff writers got a “story by” credit here and there,\\nbut \\nStudio 60\\n was ultimately a one-man show. Sorkin’s voicedominates.… [I]n its own strange way, \\nStudio 60\\n endures, albeit as an\\nepic, intermittently fascinating folly rather than as a magnum opus\\n.\\nTimes had changed, too. We aired right as TV had morphed into a\\ndifferent animal. “Appointment TV,” like \\nFriends\\n or \\nThe West Wing,\\n was\\nstarting to crater. People were recording shows to watch later; this affected\\nratings, which in turn became the story of the show, rather than the show\\nitself, which was otherwise really good.\\nBy the end of the first—and only—season, viewers had tended to agree\\nwith Rabin’s assessment, and we were down to four million viewers, and\\nonly 5 percent of TVs were tuned into the show.\\nWe were doomed.\\nI wasn’t devastated by the lack of success—as I said, I knew a hit TV\\nshow couldn’t fill my soul. And in any case, something else was filling my\\nsoul.\\nThe two years of “friends with benefits” had morphed into love. This was one\\nof the most “normal” periods of my life. True, occasionally I’d have little\\nslips, taking maybe two OxyContin, from which I’d then have to detox for six\\ndays. But the relationship had deepened to the point where there was now a\\nquestion I urgently needed to ask her.\\nOne day, I said, “I think we should stop kidding ourselves. We love each\\nother,” and she didn’t disagree. I did love her, very much. That said, our\\nintimacy issues were being sidestepped by the fact that we were both really\\ninto working. My fear of her leaving was still deeply in place, too, and who\\nknows, perhaps she was scared of me leaving her.\\nNevertheless, the moment came.\\nFor Christmas, I’d paid a huge amount of money for an artist to paint the\\ntwo of us. Our relationship had always been both sex- and text-driven—at\\nleast for the first four years—and I had found out from my business manager\\nthat we’d exchanged something like 1,780 texts. So, in the painting, on the\\nbottom right corner, there she was, sitting down with a copy of \\nThe New York\\nTimes\\n and some bottled water, as \\nshe always did, and on the bottom left therewas me, wearing a long sleeve T-shirt with another T-shirt on top of it, which\\nis what I’d always wear, holding a Red Bull and reading a \\nSports\\nIllustrated\\n … and all the while, we were texting each other. The artist had\\nadded 1,780 hearts, one for each text, and had smushed them all together to\\nmake one huge heart. I had never spent that kind of money on a gift before. I\\nloved this woman, and I wanted her to know it.\\nMy plan was to give her the painting and then ask the question. You\\nknow the one; I don’t need to tell you how it goes, especially because …\\nwell, I never asked it. I gave her the present, and she was really moved by it,\\nsaying, “Matty, my little heart—what you’re doing to my little heart.”\\nAnd it was time. All I had to do was say, “Honey, I love you. Will\\nyou…” But I didn’t say it. All my fears reared up like a snake, the snake I\\nfeared was coming to get me the year before I’d met her, the time when I’d\\nseen God but managed to learn not enough from him.\\nI immediately went into Chandler fucking Bing mode.\\n“Hey, hey, hey!” I said, to her consternation, “look \\nat\\n this!” bringing that\\nfucking Chandler cadence back one last time.\\nI had missed the moment. Maybe she’d been expecting it, who knows. I’d\\nbeen seconds away; seconds, and a lifetime. I often think if I’d asked, now\\nwe’d have two kids and a house with no view, who knows—I wouldn’t need\\nthe view, because I’d have her to look at; the kids, too. Instead, I’m some\\nschmuck who’s alone in his house at fifty-three, looking down at an unquiet\\nocean.…\\nSo I didn’t ask. I was too scared, or broken, or bent. I had remained\\ncompletely faithful to her the whole time, including the last two years, two\\nyears in which for some reason I didn’t want to have sex with her anymore,\\ntwo years in which no amount of couples therapy could explain why I’d\\nnever asked the damn question, and why now I just looked on her as my best\\nfriend only. My buddy; my \\nbest\\n buddy. And \\nI didn’t want to lose my best\\nbuddy, so I tried to make it work for two years.\\nI didn’t know then why the sex ended. I do now: the creeping, nagging,\\nendless fear that if we got any closer, she would see the real me, and leave\\nme. You see, I didn’t very much like the real me at the time. Also, our age\\ndifference had become a problem. She always wanted to go out and dothings, and I craved more of a settled life.\\nBut there were other issues, too. Her single-mindedness about her career\\ncareened into my approach to life at the time, which was to do next to\\nnothing. I was basically retired—I genuinely didn’t think I’d ever work again.\\nI was insanely rich, so I just played video games and hung out with myself.\\nBut now, what was I going to do?\\nEmbrace effort.\\nI created a TV show called \\nMr. Sunshine.\\n I subscribe to the theory that\\nlife is about the journey, not the destination, and what I had not done yet was\\nwrite, so this was my opening effort. Writing a network show about what you\\nactually want to write about is almost impossible. There are so many cooks in\\nthe kitchen—executives and other writers who all insist on having a say—\\nthat the reality of your actual vision making it to the screen is something\\nreserved only for people like Sorkin.\\nMr. Sunshine\\n is centered around my character, a guy called Ben\\nDonovan, who runs a sports arena in San Diego; Allison Janney plays my\\nboss. One of Ben’s key foibles is his inability to be available to women.…\\nAnd I even managed to put in an inside joke after the credits: my production\\ncompany was called “Anhedonia Productions,” and the ad card we crafted\\nfeatured a cartoon of me sighing with boredom on a roller coaster. But\\ndespite putting my entire self into it, the show was a big success for about\\ntwo weeks before everyone in the world decided they didn’t want to watch it.\\nBut it had been a very valuable experience, because I’d learned how to\\nmake a TV show from scratch. It’s one of those things that maybe looks easy\\nbut is actually incredibly difficult—sort of like math, or having a real\\nconversation with another human being. I had fun, but it was a marathon\\nendeavor, and I’m a sprinter. And it quickly turned a sober, video game–\\nplaying rich man into an incredibly busy man, which was not a great idea. In\\nfact, the show quickly became the priority over my sobriety, and as a result I\\nrelapsed, yet again.\\nI would \\nGo On\\n to make another show (no, no, that’s what it was \\ncalled,\\nGo On\\n) about a sports talk radio host trying to get over the death of his wife.\\nNBC was pushing and pushing that one—they even aired it during the\\nOlympics, and sixteen million people watched the premiere. But a comedyabout grief therapy? The finale, in April 2013, pulled in a scant two and a\\nhalf million. Yet again, a show I was leading opened huge and got canceled.\\nWith nothing to do, and no one to love, I relapsed one more time. I caught\\nthis one quickly, though, and checked into a rehab in Utah.\\nIt was there that I met a counselor named Burton, a Yoda-like figure who\\ntold me that I liked the drama and the chaos of my addiction problem. “What\\nare you talking about?” I said. “It’s ruined my life. It’s robbed me of every\\ngood thing I have ever had.”\\nI was really pissed off.\\nBut what if he was right?INTERLUDE\\nPockets\\nI was sitting in my room at the New York treatment center, and I was\\njonesing for opiates. The detox hadn’t worked, and my body was screaming\\nfor drugs. I told the doctor, and I told the counselor, but I really didn’t need to\\ntell them anything—I was stirring and shaking, clearly withdrawing.\\nThey did nothing. I was lost. I was sick. It was time to take matters into\\nmy own hands.\\nI picked up the phone and made some arrangements.\\nThe rule was, if you left the premises, you had to do a pee test\\nimmediately upon returning. So I walked outside, met the vehicle, handed\\nover some money, retrieved some pills, and they were off. Back in the\\ntreatment center I headed directly to the bathroom, did the pee test, then\\nswallowed three pills.\\nGenius, right?\\nNot so fast.\\nJust as the pills kicked in, and my body was beginning to feel like warm\\nhoney again, it was almost as if the moment I stopped shaking, there was a\\nknock on my door.\\nOh fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.\\nThe counselor and one of the nurses walked in.\\n“Somebody called to say there had been a drug deal outside the facility,”\\nthe counselor announced. “I need to check your coat.”\\nFuck!\\n“Really?” I said, wide-eyed with fake wonder. “Well, you won’t find any\\npills on me. I’m good,” I said, already knowing they’d find pills on me, and Iwasn’t good, not even close.\\nSure enough, there were pills in my pocket (I put them there). They took\\nthe pills away and told me that they’d deal with it in the morning. This meant\\nI was still high for about four more hours, but there would be hell to pay the\\nnext day.\\nAt 10:00 \\nA.M.\\n the following morning, all the powers that be in this awful\\nplace had gathered in a circle. Their message was simple: you’re out.\\n“You’re kicking me out?” I said. “I can’t believe my fucking ears. This is\\na drug rehab, right? Why are you all so fucking surprised that someone did\\ndrugs here? I told two of you that I was sick and you did nothing—what the\\nfuck was I supposed to do? And please, for the love of God, wipe those\\nshocked looks off your faces. I’m a drug addict, I did some drugs, that’s what\\nwe do!”\\nA few phone calls were made, and I was ushered off to some unknown\\nrehab in Pennsylvania.\\nBut there I was shuffled to another state like a ball in a pinball machine.\\nThe one upside? This place allowed smoking. Moments after arriving, I had\\nmy first cigarette in nine months, which felt awfully good.\\nLittle problem though: I was addicted to six milligrams of Ativan at the\\ntime, and this new place didn’t give out Ativan, something that maybe the\\nNew York place could have checked on but didn’t. My own experiences and\\nyears of conversations with other addicts has led me to \\nbelieve that most of\\nthese places are pieces of shit anyway. They’re hell-bent on taking advantage\\nof sick needy people and cashing paychecks. The whole system is corrupt and\\ncompletely fucked-up.\\nTake it from me. I’m an expert. I’ve poured millions of dollars into this\\n“system.”\\nDid the money help me, or hurt me? There’s no way I could run out of\\nmoney doing drugs or alcohol. Does that make it harder?\\nI’m glad we’ll never know.8\\nOdyssey\\nAfter \\nFriends,\\n after the movies, after that six-year relationship, fall and rise\\nand rise and fall—after everything—for the next six years I found myself\\nbound upon an odyssey. Contrary to how it might appear, I was not a man\\nwith a lot of money with nothing much to do; in fact, I had more to do than\\never. No, I was a man falling down a mountainside, lost in a raging river,\\nhoping to find refuge on any safe and dry rock.\\nBetween \\nMr. Sunshine\\n and \\nGo On\\n I’d headed to Cirque Lodge, in Sun\\nValley, Utah—rehab number three, if you’re scoring at home. The Lodge sits\\nat the base of Mount Timpanogos, in the Utah Rockies. I am not a big nature\\nguy—in terms of peaceful locations, I prefer the ocean, or at least a view of\\nthe ocean—but this place was stunning. The air was thin and true, razor-\\nsharp, clarifying. There were turkeys all around, gobbling fit to bust (flying\\nonce in a while, too—who knew they flew?), and golden eagles, and some\\ndays, a moose would wander by, heavy and slow (no, really, there \\nwere\\nmoose there; I wasn’t hallucinating).\\nBeyond its beauty, Cirque Lodge also boasted a crack staff—they knew\\nwhat they were doing. My counselor Burton (who, if his face was green, I\\nwould have sworn was Yoda) wound up being deeply helpful to \\nme—with\\nboth the real problems I brought with me, and the invented ones I carried\\nwith me at all times. (He happens to be one of the men I’ve ever said “I love\\nyou” to.) I arrived very scared (a prerequisite for entering rehab, but deeply\\nuncomfortable nonetheless), and Burton’s soothing voice made me feel a tiny\\nbit better almost instantly.\\n“Discover, uncover, and discard” was one of the major mantras at Cirque,and I was excited to think I could at least do that last one—it was time to get\\nrid of all this shit, once and for all. At this point I was such an expert on the\\n12 steps (and everything else they tend to focus on in rehab) … so much so\\nthat while at Cirque I spent a lot of my time helping out the newbies and\\ntrying to have a little fun. I had a Ping-Pong table brought in and even\\ninvented a game revolving around a red ball that we threw back and forth, all\\nof which kept my fellow inmates enthused for hours on end and gave me a\\nboost of purpose. I wanted to help so much; I was good at it.\\nI was under the impression that during this stay I was going to have to do\\ndeep trauma work, reaching back into my childhood, and pulling up all that\\nold pain and loneliness, thereby beginning the very painful process of letting\\nthese things go. The idea was that if I got over these traumatic events, I\\nwould no longer feel the need to cover them up with drugs and alcohol.\\nBurton, however, saw things differently. He accused me of liking the\\ndrama of my addiction and asked how I could have so much fun while at\\nCirque Lodge yet be so troubled by almost everything that took place out\\nthere in the real world.\\nThis question was instantly offensive to me. \\nI like this?\\n How could\\nBurton look at my decades of addiction and terror, my lack of control, my\\nobvious inner torture, and say I \\nliked\\n it?\\nDuring Family and Friends Week it was normal for participants to invite\\npeople to come and visit, but I resisted it hard. My father had visited me at\\nHazelden, my mother at Promises Malibu, and my \\nthen-girlfriend had spent\\ncountless hours witnessing me rant while detoxing with a myriad of home\\nnurses and sober companions. I didn’t want to put them through this yet\\nagain. It was too painful, too hard, too unfair. I wanted them to catch a break;\\nit was the least I could do. I had gotten myself into this mess, I’d get myself\\nout.\\nBut one day around the time of Friends and Family Week, I found myself\\nsitting outside, alone, hoping a moose would show or a turkey do its flappy\\nthing up into the trees. The day was freezing cold, subzero, but I still needed\\nto smoke, so there was nothing to do but bundle up and deal.… As I sat there\\npuffing on a Marlboro, a light snow began to fall, bringing on an intense\\nhush, as though the universe was patiently listening to my head and heart.I wonder what the universe heard.\\nI began to think about why I hadn’t wanted any visitors during this stay,\\nand something profound hit me.… Why am I excusing my family and loved\\nones from having to go through this hell, and not \\nmyself?\\nWith that thought, I realized that Burton’s advice was right—I \\ndid\\n like the\\nchaos. It was time to give myself a break. Drugs hadn’t given me what I\\nneeded in a long time, yet I kept going back to them and risking my life in\\norder to … what? \\nEscape?\\n Escape from \\nwhat\\n? The worst thing I had to run\\naway from was my alcoholism and addiction, so using drink and drugs to do\\nso … well, you can see the logical impossibility. None of it made sense, not\\neven in the slightest. I was smart enough to see that; doing something about\\nit, though … that was another level of math that I hadn’t yet discovered.\\nChange is still scary, even when your life is on the line.\\nBut at least I was finally asking good questions, even if the answers\\nweren’t entirely clear. I knew deep down that life is about the simple joys of\\nthrowing a red ball back and forth, of watching a moose lope across a\\nclearing. I needed to let myself off the hook for all the things doing the\\ndamage, like still being angry with my parents, being unaccompanied \\nall\\nthose years ago, of not being enough, of being terrified of commitment\\nbecause I was terrified of the end of commitment.\\nI needed to remember that my dad left because he was afraid, and my\\nmom was a kid who was just doing her best. It wasn’t her fault that she’d had\\nto commit so much time to the fucking Canadian prime minister—it was\\nnever going to be a nine-to-five job, even with a kid at home. But I couldn’t\\nsee that back then, and here we are.…\\nI needed to move on, and up, and realize that there was a whole big world\\nout there and it was not out to get me. In fact, it had no opinion about me. It\\njust \\nwas,\\n like the animals and the shiv-sharp air; the universe was neutral, and\\nbeautiful, and continued with or without me.\\nIn fact, I was alive in a world where, despite its neutrality, I had managed\\nto create for myself an important, meaningful place. I needed to realize that\\nwhen I died, I wanted my \\nFriends\\n credit to be way down on the list of things\\nI had accomplished. I needed to remind myself to be nice to people—to have\\nthem bumping into me be a happy experience, not one that necessarily had tofill me with dread, as though that was all that mattered. I needed to be kind,\\nto love well, to listen better, to give unconditionally. It was time to stop being\\nsuch a scared asshole and realize that as situations came up, I would be able\\nto handle them. Because I was strong.\\nEventually the snow slowed, and out of the coming gloom a moose\\nsilently bulked into the gardens. It was a female, that long face serene, as\\nthough it had seen everything at least once and wasn’t fazed by anything.\\nThere was a lesson in that,\\n I thought. Behind her, a couple of calves kept\\npace, filled with that energy only kids possess. They all looked at me, sitting\\nthere in the twilight, and then they turned and wandered away.\\nPerhaps this was the lesson the universe was sending. I didn’t matter, not\\nin any great cosmic sense. I was just one more human being spinning in\\ninfinite circles.\\nTo learn that was enough. I stubbed out the Marlboro and headed back in\\nto lead yet another game of Red Ball.\\nI came out of Cirque Lodge thin and happy and ready to take on the world,\\nand ready to be with my girlfriend forever. But my then-girlfriend didn’t like\\nthis new Matty very much—I got the sense that she didn’t appreciate it that I\\nneeded her less than before. Perhaps my problems had created a sense of\\nsecurity for her. \\nThis guy will never leave me, not while he is so wrapped up\\nin his own problems.\\n She didn’t like that I was better. And that unfortunate\\ntruth was our final downfall. After trying hard to make the various pieces fit,\\nwe admitted defeat and broke up. It was very sad all around. She was my\\nfavorite person on the face of the planet, but it was not meant to be. It was the\\nright thing, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t sad.\\nNow what, yet again?\\nI filled the hole initially with activism, but in doing so I flew too close to\\nthe sun and managed to lose my last semblance of innocence.\\nBack in 2001 I’d spent time at a rehab called Promises, in Malibu (right\\nafter I’d first picked up AA’s Big Book in Marina del Rey). There, I’d met a\\nguy called Earl H. He had been hosting a class at Promises, and I had liked\\nhim immediately. He was funny and incredibly knowledgeable about AA. Hehad several other celebrity clients, too, who were doing well, so I thought\\nhe’d be my guy and I asked him to sponsor me. (He said he hadn’t had a\\ndrink since 1980.) Over coffee I admitted that one of the concerns I had was\\nthat one day he’d pass me a script to read. He said, “Well, there \\nis\\n a script,\\nbut I wouldn’t do that to you.…”\\nSo began our relationship. I worked the steps with him—in fact, I would\\nchase him down to do them. I was so desperate to get with the program and\\nstay sober that I would call him daily and ask to work. \\nHe claimed nobody\\nhad ever chased him harder, and over the course of the following ten years,\\nhe came to wear two hats—he was my sponsor, but he was also my best\\nfriend. I looked up to him and listened to him. We had the same sense of\\nhumor and sort of even \\nsounded\\n the same. I ignored the fact that he was sort\\nof famous in the rehab world, a world in which everything should be\\nanonymous.\\nBut my biggest mistake was that I had sort of made him my higher power.\\nIf I had a relationship issue, if I had an issue with anything, I would call him,\\nand he would be very smart about it. It got to the point where if he’d said\\n“I’m sorry, Matthew, but you have to move to Alaska and stand on your\\nhead,” I would have immediately booked a ticket to Anchorage. If he said,\\n“You can eat nothing but green M&M’s for the next three months,” you can\\nrest assured I would have been shitting khaki.\\nDeep down, though, I knew full well that making your sponsor your best\\nfriend was a bad idea, but Earl was everything to me. He’d become my\\nfather, my mentor. I would go watch him speak (he was a hilarious and very\\neffective speaker); we would go to movies together. I would have my\\nrelapses and he would help, finding me treatment centers. It’s no\\nexaggeration to say that he probably saved my life several times.\\nAnd then, our friendship turned into a business. Yes, I went into business\\nwith my sponsor. Fatal fucking mistake.\\nEarl had started a company that was going to establish sober living\\nhouses around Los Angeles that he would then run. I invested $500,000 in the\\ncompany and turned my house in Malibu into a sober living place called\\nPerry House. Along the way, at the behest of a great guy called West\\nHuddleston, head of the National Association of Drug Court Professionals,Earl and I headed several times to Washington, DC, to meet with lawmakers\\nto push the efficacy of drug courts. Drug courts aim to decriminalize\\nnonviolent addicts, offering them care and \\ntreatment instead of jail time. In\\nMay 2013, Gil Kerlikowske, then Obama’s “drug czar,” even managed to\\ngive me a prize, a “Champion of Recovery award” from the Obama\\nadministration’s Office of National Drug Control Policy. I joked to \\nThe\\nHollywood Reporter\\n at the time that “had I been arrested, I would be sitting\\nin prison somewhere with a tattoo on my face.”\\nI also guest hosted \\nPiers Morgan Live\\n that same month, talking to Lisa\\nKudrow and Lauren Graham, but also focusing on issues of addiction and\\nrecovery. I was trying to find out what I wanted to do moving forward, and I\\nfelt comfortable doing the show. I began by saying I was not Piers Morgan,\\nand the way you could tell that for sure was that “I don’t have a British\\naccent, and I don’t have a first name that sounds very pointy,” which caused\\nLisa to giggle out loud. I thought, \\nMaybe this is my future?\\n I even got to joke\\nthat my forthcoming autobiography would be called \\nStill a Boy.\\nOops.\\nEither way, I was now a talk show host, and an award-winning addict.\\nHow the fuck did \\nthat\\n happen?\\nEarl had originally been slated to appear on \\nPiers Morgan\\n with me but\\nhad bailed at the last minute. Still, we later headed to Europe to push the\\npower of drug courts there, and I got to debate the issue on a late-night BBC\\nnews show called \\nNewsnight.\\n There was the moderator, a cranky guy called\\nJeremy Paxman who was famous for being rude to guests; Baroness\\nMeacher, who was the then-chair of the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group\\non Drug Policy Reform and deeply on my side; and then a complete tool\\ncalled Peter Hitchens.\\nI can’t imagine what it’s like to have a sibling whom everyone adores\\nwhen you’re the idiot brother everyone loathes, but I think Peter could well\\nbe able to weigh in on what that feels like. The loss of Peter’s wonderful\\nbrother, the great Christopher Hitchens, still reverberates—an unmatched\\nraconteur, writer, arguer, and bon vivant, and the world \\nmourns Christopher\\nstill, more than a decade after his brutal death from cancer. Sadly, his\\nyounger brother, Peter, is still pontificating on things he has no idea about,mixing right-wing ideology with a kind of paternalism and moral tutting.\\nHitchens showed up on \\nNewsnight\\n to expound his bizarre views that drug\\ntaking is just a case of weak morals (“There’s an immense fashion at the\\nmoment,” he sneered, “for dismissing the ability of people to take \\ncontrol\\nover their own lives, and to make \\nexcuses\\n for them,” sounding like some\\ninsane great-aunt who’d had one too many glasses of sherry). Even more\\nbizarrely, he later “argued” that addiction isn’t even a real thing. I like to\\nthink that both the baroness and I ran rings around him—but frankly, that\\nwasn’t hard. Apart from pointing out that I thought he was going to show up\\nwearing big-boy pants to the interview, but he clearly hadn’t, I also managed\\nto point out repeatedly that the American Medical Association had diagnosed\\naddiction as a disease in 1976 and that he was about the only person on the\\nplanet who didn’t agree with that assessment. He didn’t like that much, and\\neventually the interview ended with Paxman and Baroness Meacher simply\\nlaughing out loud at how stupid and cruel Hitchens sounded:\\nHitchens: \\nSo how is it that people ever cease to be addicts if what you say\\nis true?\\nMe: \\nWell, Santa …\\nHitchens: \\nYeah, that’s\\n terribly \\nclever, but this is a very serious subject.\\nAnd you treat it with immense levity …\\nProving, I suppose, that he knew nothing about either me, or the subject\\non which he pontificated.\\nMeanwhile, even though I’d made Peter Hitchens look like the fool he is\\nand advocated for drug courts all over Europe, Stateside, Perry \\nHouse was\\nfloundering. Not enough people attended—it was simply too expensive, so I\\nhad to cut my losses and sell the property.\\nWhen I had lunch with Earl, I asked for my money back, and I’m still\\nwaiting. He was talking about crazy things, like maybe becoming an actor.\\nSomething was off, and I was so freaked out by the whole thing—well, I\\nwent home and used. This was no one’s fault but my own, but two things\\nwere crucially lost forever: my innocence, and my trust in Earl H.\\nEventually Earl moved to Arizona without even telling me, and our\\nfriendship was over. From sharing our lives and being best friends andagitating for drug courts and building a sober living home, I’d lost half a\\nmillion dollars, my closest ally, and that innocence I’d cherished all those\\nyears. Heartbreak.\\nI had been writing television for years but always with a partner. The day\\nafter the Earl H. debacle, I was feeling especially uncomfortable and ill at\\nease, and I remembered that a wise man once told me that in times like these\\nI should be creative. So, I opened up my laptop and started typing. I didn’t\\nknow what I was typing. I just kept typing. It became apparent that what was\\ncoming out was a play.\\nI needed this; I’d recently let my standards down horribly, and I was\\ndetermined to crawl my way back to something closer to being able to\\ncontemplate looking in a mirror.\\nI was angry at myself over what had happened on \\nThe Odd Couple\\n on\\nCBS. For a long time, I’d been a huge fan of the film of Neil Simon’s play\\nand had always wanted to do a new TV version of it. My dream came true in\\n2013 when CBS had finally green-lit the idea. \\nGo On,\\n the show I did before\\nThe Odd Couple,\\n hadn’t worked, but I felt more confident about this one. The\\nsource material was brilliant; the cast great; everything was set fair to have a\\nhit. Yet, depression stalked me, \\nand my addictions were back in full force.\\nAccordingly, I’m completely embarrassed about my behavior on \\nThe Odd\\nCouple\\n. On top of the horrible depression, I showed up late all the time, and\\nhigh, and ultimately lost all power on the show to a showrunner. But I take\\ncomplete responsibility for what happened and would like to apologize not\\nonly to my fellow castmates but also to everyone involved.\\nWith that disaster in the rearview, I had a play in hand at least. Feeling\\nthat dis-ease, that discomfort coming out of my skin, usually I would use\\ndrugs to replace it, to give myself ease. But I was sober now, so I knew I\\ncouldn’t do that—I had to find something else. I wrote ten hours a day for ten\\ndays straight until I had completed the play—and it was actually good,\\naccording to the very few people I let read it. I’d called it \\nThe End of\\nLonging,\\n and though it had taken ten days to draft, I spent another year\\nperfecting it.I’d been inspired by—and when I say inspired, I mean I was trying to\\nbeat—\\nSexual Perversity in Chicago,\\n and was happy with what I’d achieved.\\nI’d put it up against that fine play any day. In describing what I was trying to\\ndo, I’d told \\nThe Hollywood Reporter\\n that “there’s a very popular notion that\\npeople don’t change, but I see people change every day, and I wanted to put\\nthat message out there while making people laugh.” Accordingly, the play\\nfinds four friends in a bar trying to discover love—my character, Jack, opens\\nthe play as an egomaniac who happens to be an alcoholic, and then it only\\ngets worse.\\nMe being me, I was not content to have just written a play—I decided it\\nneeded to be staged and have me in it. Months later, \\nThe End of Longing\\npremiered in London’s hallowed West End theater district. I loved being the\\nplaywright as well as the lead—I could change things around when they\\nweren’t working. And though I knew I’d hate doing the big drunk scene\\nevery night—it was surely going to be intensely triggering—I knew, too, that\\nI had to show just how low a person can go.\\nWe opened in the Playhouse Theatre, an eight-hundred-seat venue, \\nand\\nquickly we were selling out. In fact, we were pulling down massive box-\\noffice records, but also, lousy reviews. For historical accuracy, there were\\nseven major reviews and six of them were bad. London reviewers didn’t like\\nthe idea of a Hollywood actor-boy going over there and doing a play. It was a\\nhuge success, though, and I was a playwright and I liked that idea.\\nThere was also one person who wouldn’t come to the play, even though I\\nbegged.\\nThe woman I’d dated for six years was, by now, dating a British guy, and\\nthey were spending half the year in London, the rest in Los Angeles. We\\nwere still friendly enough that we’d had a couple of lunches and texted a few\\ntimes. Knowing that she was in London, I’d invited her to see \\nThe End of\\nLonging,\\n but she’d texted back that she was way too busy. “I’ll see you\\nStateside!” she wrote. I replied that I was a little hurt that she couldn’t make\\nit—the play was being performed in her town, for God’s sake—and then a\\nwhile later I got back an email telling me that she was getting married and\\nthat she had no room in her life for friends.\\nI never replied to that email, and we’ve never spoken since. It was anincredibly harsh way to reveal the news that she was getting married, and not\\nsomething that I would ever do to a person, but there you have it. Even still, I\\nwill forever be planted in her corner. I’m glad she got married and that she’s\\nhappy. I want nothing but the best for her, forever.\\nFrom London the play moved to New York. That was not fun. For a start, I\\nhad to tone the play down—the Brits didn’t care about the salty language, but\\nBroadway is Broadway, so I had to leaven it, and not just the language—I\\nhad to kill a bunch of the jokes, too. So, it was neither well received nor\\nbeloved in New York—\\nThe New York Times\\n \\ntrashed it, calling it “synthetic,”\\nwhatever that means, and I ended up making $600 for the whole New York\\nrun. That’s not a typo. (I’d made one thousand times more—almost to the\\npound, shilling, and pence—during its run in London.) At least \\nThe\\nHollywood Reporter\\n was nice about it: “Perry at least demonstrates that his\\nextensive television comedy experience has rubbed off. The evening features\\nmany amusing one-liners (most of them, predictably, delivered by the\\nauthor).… Perry displays his familiar expert comic timing and delivery.” But\\nthe “at least” was pretty crushing, and I realized that \\nThe End of Longing\\nwasn’t going to be beloved enough to cement my future as a budding David\\nMamet. But there is still time!INTERLUDE\\nTrauma Camp\\nThere is such a thing as a Trauma Camp, and yes, I’ve attended, and yes, I\\nmade up that name.\\nIt was in Florida—where else?—and I spent ninety days there, opening\\nup the trauma of my life and reliving it, scene by scene. I did it in a group\\nsetting—others reciprocated their traumas until everyone was fainting and\\npuking and shaking. At one point, I was asked to draw the stick figures of all\\nmy traumas, and then asked to show everyone what I’d drawn and describe it.\\nAs I tried to point to one of the drawings, my fingers started to shake, and\\nsubsequently my whole body joined in, and it wouldn’t stop shaking for\\nthirty-six days. I was like a goat who’d had a close encounter with a bear—\\nthe bear was gone, but the goat kept shaking.\\nAt the end of trauma therapy, once you’ve gone back into the trauma and\\nrelived it, the therapists are supposed to “close” you back up—basically\\nyou’re supposed to feel everything, and release it, and learn how to make it a\\nstory, not a living thing in your soul, so that it no longer has dominion over\\nyou in the way that it did.\\nOh, and you’re supposed to cry.\\nThey didn’t close me up right; and I didn’t cry. I was afraid. I felt \\nlike I\\nwas back onstage. Being famous in rehab isn’t perhaps what you imagine—\\neveryone else there has a lot to deal with, so who cares if you’re Matthew\\nPerry? Later, in Pennsylvania, I attended a rehab with six other people who\\nwere all in their seventies, including Debbie, aka, the bane of my existence.\\nDebbie was the only other smoker, so I had to see Debbie all the time outside.\\nAnd Debbie had zero memory.“Wait, have we met?” she’d say.\\n“No, Debbie, we have not. But I was on the show \\nFriends\\n once. That’s\\nprobably how you know me.”\\n“Oh! I like that show,” Debbie would say.\\nFive minutes later, Debbie would pause, sucking on her cigarette, and\\nturn to me.\\n“So, did we go to high school together?”\\n“No, Debbie,” I’d say, as kindly as I could muster. “You are twenty-\\nseven years older than me. You probably recognize me from the show\\nFriends.…”\\n“Oh! I like that show,” Debbie would repeat, and the whole cycle would\\nbegin again.9\\nThree’s Not Company, Three Ruins\\nEverything\\nWhen a man or woman asks me to help them quit drinking, and I do so,\\nwatching as the light slowly comes back into their eyes, that’s all God to me.\\nAnd even though I have a relationship with God, and I’m so often grateful\\ndespite everything, I sometimes do want to tell God to go fuck himself for\\nmaking my road so hard.\\nWhen I’m clean and sober, it is as if a light has been shown to me, one\\nthat I can share with a desperate man who needs help with stopping drinking.\\nIt’s the same light that hits the ocean in a bright sunlight, the beautiful gold\\nwater glistening. That’s what God is to me. (It also works at night when the\\nmoonlight hits the water—boom! It almost knocks me over. Because like that\\nfive-year-old boy flying across a continent alone seeing the city lights of Los\\nAngeles and he knows he is about to be parented … well, it’s all the same.)\\nWhy is it so hard for me to stay sober when I see my fellows seemingly\\ndoing it easily? Why has my road been so racked with difficulty? Why have I\\nwrestled so hard with life? Why has reality been an acquired taste, and why\\nhas it been so hard for me to acquire it? But when \\nI help that one man to get\\nsober, or even helped thousands get sober in a weekend at a retreat or\\nconference, all these questions get washed away. It’s like I’m standing under\\na Hawaiian waterfall getting drenched by the beautiful warm water. That’s\\nwhere God is; you’re just going to have to have to trust me on that.\\nI am no saint—none of us are—but once you have been at death’s door\\nand you don’t die, you would think you would be bathed in relief andgratitude. But that isn’t it at all—instead, you look at the difficult road ahead\\nof you to get better and you are \\npissed.\\n Something else happens, too. You are\\nplagued by this nagging question: \\nWhy have I been spared?\\n The other four\\npeople on the ECMO machine were still dead. There had to be a reason.\\nPart of the answer for me was my ten thousand hours of experience in AA\\nand helping people get sober. That lights me up, loans me, in fact, a little bit\\nof that golden light from my kitchen.\\nBut there has to be more, God. Why did you spare \\nme\\n? I’m ready—give\\nme the direction and I will follow it. When Woody Allen asks this very\\nquestion to an alien in the movie \\nStardust Memories,\\n the alien responds, “Tell\\nfunnier jokes.” But that can’t be it.\\nEither way, I’m ready. And I seek the answer every day. I am a seeker. I\\nseek God.\\nMy love life, however, is a different story. I have made more mistakes in my\\nlove life than Elizabeth Taylor. I am a romantic, passionate person. I have\\nlonged for love; it’s a yearning in me that I cannot fully explain.\\nOnce I reached my forties, the rules had changed. I had done all the\\nsleeping with people I’d ever need to do—I was looking for a partner now, a\\nteammate, someone to share my life with. Also, I have always loved kids. I\\nthink it’s because I was ten years old when my sister Caitlin \\nwas born. Then\\ncame Emily, then Will, and then finally Madeline. I loved playing with them\\nall, babysitting them, playing dumb games with them. There is no greater\\nsound on the face of the planet than a child’s laughter.\\nSo, by the time my forties were in full swing, I truly wanted a girlfriend,\\nsomeone I could count on, and who, in turn, could count on me. One night\\nsome friends and I were out celebrating that yet again I had achieved a year\\nof sobriety. My still good friend David Pressman introduced me to his\\ngirlfriend’s sister, Laura. We’d all gone to a Dodgers game together, but for\\nme there was no game, no stadium, no hot dog vendors—instead, the world\\nhad receded to a beautiful face under a baseball cap. I tried to pull out the old\\nPerry charm—anything to make her notice me—but she was too busy\\nparading her glorious personality and wit to others. She was unimpressed thatI had been Chandler, and though she was perfectly pleasant to me, I sensed\\nthere was no there-there for her.\\nAs I drove home that night, I gave myself a speech.\\n“Yes, you’re disappointed, but not every girl is not going to like you,\\nMatty.” I let it go, but I didn’t forget her. Surely our paths would cross again.\\nAnd they did.\\nThis time the group had decided to play Ping-Pong at the Standard Hotel\\nin downtown LA. Now, I am no Forrest Gump, but I knew my way around a\\nPing-Pong table—in fact, if you’ve seen the finale of season nine of \\nFriends,\\nyou’ll know that I’m at least good enough to beat Paul Rudd. I had heard that\\nLaura might make an appearance, so I played Ping-Pong with one eye on the\\ndoor.\\nAnd there she was, finally. It was as if she had been hurled into the club\\nby a tornado—she was all energy and jokes.\\n“Everyone in here should kill themselves,” Laura said, and BOOM! like a\\nbrick of interest slamming into my face. But this time I was \\nready. So began a\\nnight that resembled a knife fight, only with jokes. It turned out that the new\\nobject of my affection was a stand-up comedian and a successful writer in\\nTV. It was clear from the get-go that we would never run out of things to say\\nto each other.\\nOur first date was on New Year’s Eve. A friend was holding a pajama\\nparty and I invited Laura to go with me. After that, our relationship\\ndeveloped slowly; she was careful, and I was willing to do whatever it took.\\nBut our affections deepened. It was all good … ah, but nothing is all good in\\nmy world, remember?\\nEnter Rome. I was two years sober and thriving in AA, healthy,\\nsponsoring people, writing a TV show. I was happy, even pretty muscular,\\ndare I say. (I \\ndare\\n: I’d been hitting the gym and everything!) I was asked to\\nshare my story at an AA meeting in West Hollywood, and you’re not allowed\\nto say no to an AA request. The room was packed, standing room only (I\\nthink word had gotten out that I was speaking). My story at the time had not\\nreached the depths of the last few years, so as well as detailing everything I’d\\ngone through, I was also able to get my share of laughs. At one point, I\\nlooked over to the kitchen area and noticed a woman pop her head throughthe window/hatch thingy, leaning on her elbows to prop herself up. She\\nresembled a gorgeous, porcelain doll and was staggeringly beautiful. All of a\\nsudden, there were only two people in the room. My AA share became\\ndirected only at Rome. It ended up being one of the greatest shares I had ever\\ngiven, because this epic beauty was so captivating that I wanted her to know\\neverything about me. I wanted her to know everything.\\nAfterward, as we all gathered outside for a cigarette, we started talking\\nand flirting.\\n“So, what are you up to right now?” she said.\\n“I’m going to go home to write. All of a sudden, I’ve become a writer,” I\\nsaid.\\n“Well,” Rome said, “I make an excellent muse.”\\n“I’ll bet you do,” I said, then turned and walked away, completely bowled\\nover by this mysterious person.\\nOn the way home I gave myself a talking-to.\\nBut what about Laura? Yes, of course, wonderful Laura, who I am falling\\nfor more and more each day. But now there is Rome. What is a fella to do?\\nForget about Rome and continue investigating this Laura thing that is going\\nso well. Right? That’s what a normal person does under these circumstances.\\nBut Rome had cast a spell on me.\\nDespite my positive self-talk, this was when I made a crucial, killing\\nmistake. I didn’t know it was a mistake at the time—do any of us know that\\nwe are making mistakes while we are making them? If we did, perhaps we\\nwouldn’t make them?\\nThe mistake was this, and it was a doozy: I began dating both women.\\nThis is not a move I recommend under any circumstances, but especially\\nif you are me.\\nI told myself that because I had not told either Laura or Rome that we\\nwere in a relationship, I was not being an asshole, but there was a little piece\\nof me that knew I was doing something untoward because I cared about both\\nof them, and despite outward appearances, I genuinely didn’t want anyone to\\nget hurt, including me. So, Laura and I would go to Kings games together,\\nlaugh and have a wonderful time, though somewhat chaste. The courtship\\nwith both women went slowly, but eventually both removed their sexembargoes, and I was now fully involved with two different women at the\\nsame time. It was amazing, and completely baffling and crazy making.\\nDid I mention that I had fallen madly in love with both of them? I didn’t\\nthink it was even possible to do that. I even went online, read a few articles,\\nand learned that this was something that did indeed happen. The feelings I\\nhad for both of these women were real, according to what \\nI read. Then, Laura\\nand I pronounced ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend, Rome and I not so much\\n—but I was still in trouble.\\nWhat was I going to do? I enjoyed my time with both of them equally. I\\nloved them. This went on for about six months before I came to my senses\\nand decided I had to pick one. I had to stop this nonsense and pick one. Rome\\nwas passionate, erotic, funny, smart, but she also seemed to have this\\nfascination with death that confused me. Laura talked about movies and\\nlighter things; there was a sense of being home with her that I had not felt\\nwith Rome.\\nI chose Laura.\\nI made the very difficult call to Rome. At first, she was chill about it,\\nuntil she wasn’t, subsequently screaming at me for two hours in the parking\\nlot of Barney’s Beanery on Santa Monica Boulevard when I tried to make\\namends. You would be hard-pressed to find an angrier person than she was\\nwith me that day.\\nBut by now you know me; you know I can’t do with getting closer and\\ncloser to someone, and that was what was happening with Laura. The fear\\nwas burrowing into me. To break up with Laura would be insane—she had it\\nall. \\nWe\\n had it all. We were each other’s best friend. But the intimacy was\\nscaring me. I knew once again that if she got to know me any better she\\nwould see what I already believed about myself: As ever, I wasn’t enough. I\\ndidn’t matter. Soon, she would see this for herself, and she would leave me.\\nThat would annihilate me, and I would never recover.\\nThere was another option. I could remain in the relationship but turn back\\nto drugs and try to maintain a low habit. This would protect me from the fear,\\nallow me to drop my walls and become even more intimate with her.\\nTurning to drugs has led to nothing but chaos for me. And yet,\\ninconceivably, I chose to do it one more time to deal with the Laura situation.I started taking one pill a day just in order to stay in the \\nrelationship. It\\nworked out great at first, but as is the way with drugs, they always win. Six\\nmonths later we had a shitstorm on our hands. I was a mess. Laura broke up\\nwith me, and I had to go on Suboxone once again and check into a sober\\nliving house. I was afraid I was going to die yet again. Rome was still yelling\\nat me every chance she had, and Laura was hurt and worried, oh, and gone.\\nOh, there was something else the magazines said about being in love with\\ntwo people at the same time. It always has the same ending.\\nYou lose them both.\\nSo, there I was, living in a Malibu sober living house on 8 milligrams of\\nSuboxone. Though it’s a solid detox drug—the best—as I’ve said over and\\nover, it is the hardest drug on the planet to get off. In fact, it made me suicidal\\nto come off it. That’s not quite accurate—I had suicidal feelings, but I also\\nknew it was just the medicine, so I wasn’t actually suicidal, if you follow. All\\nI had to do was stave off the days when I felt suicidal, not do anything about\\nit, and know that at some point I would feel better and not want to kill myself\\nanymore.\\nTo get off Suboxone, you have to drop a milligram a week until you get\\nto zero. Doing so makes you feel insanely sick for two days, then you get\\nused to the new level—in this case, 7 milligrams—and once you stabilize,\\nthen you drop again. The suicidal feelings don’t start until you get down to 2\\nmilligrams.\\nSo, at 2 milligrams I did probably the most selfish thing I have ever done\\nin my life. I was terrified about how I was about to feel, and I didn’t want to\\ngo through it alone. Accordingly, I purchased three hundred dollars’ worth of\\nflowers, drove to Laura’s house, and begged her to take me back. We sat on\\nthe couch in her living room and discussed the ins and outs of what this\\nwould mean. Driven completely by fear, I told her I wanted to marry her,\\npossibly even have a child with her.\\nAnd then, something impossible happened. As we were sitting there, I\\nheard a key slowly turning in her front door … and in walked Rome.\\nIn walked \\nwho\\n now?\\nHow is it possible that these two women were standing in the same room?\\nI would give anything to have a time machine, go back to that moment, andsay, “How about a threesome?” But this was no time for jokes. My jaw was\\non the floor.\\n“I’m going to water the plants,” Rome said, and she headed up the back\\nstairwell and was gone.\\n“I think I need to take care of her,” Laura said, and left me in the living\\nroom. When I realized she wasn’t coming back, I took my 2-milligram\\naddiction back to Malibu.\\nIt turned out that Rome and Laura had met at an AA meeting, realized\\nwho they were, and become fast friends. The bulk of their conversations, as\\nI’m sure you can imagine, were about what an asshole I was.\\nAs for me, I couldn’t stay in Los Angeles, so I hopped on a private plane\\nto a Colorado recovery center where they said that they thought that they\\ncould get me off Suboxone without making me feel suicidal.\\nWell, so much for that idea. I felt suicidal for thirty-six days in a row and\\nthen flew to New York and appeared on Letterman, trying to hide that I was\\nbeing held up with tape and paper.\\nSomehow, I pulled it off.\\nSeven years later, after I had learned a whole lot about myself, I made real\\namends to Rome and to Laura, and they both accepted my apology. Believe it\\nor not, the three of us are friends, now. Laura is married to a lovely guy\\nnamed Jordon, and Rome is living with an equally lovely guy named Eric.\\nRecently the five of us had dinner together at my place, and we all had a\\nlovely time. Then, at around 10:00 \\nP.M\\n., the two couples left in their\\nrespective cars. I heard the engines recede down the canyon toward the city.\\nOut back, as I waited for something to come to me, anything that might\\nmake things better, instead I once again heard the sound of coyotes.\\nNo, it’s the sound of me, alone, fending off the demons for one more\\nnight. They’d won. And I knew I’d lost as I headed back up to my lonely\\nbedroom to fend off those demons and negotiate sleep one more time.INTERLUDE\\nViolence in Hollywood\\nI am not a violent man, but I have been both the victim and the perpetrator of\\nviolence one time each in my life.\\nYears ago, right after she quit seeing Justin Timberlake, I got set up on a\\ndate with Cameron Diaz.\\nAt the time, I was working out a lot and had developed big arms. For the\\ndate I prepared accordingly, taking a long walk with my sleeves rolled to my\\nshoulders so that my guns were appropriately tanned (pro tip: this helps them\\nlook even bigger). Yes, I literally tanned my arms for this date.\\nThe date was at a dinner party with a bunch of other people, but upon\\nseeing me, Cameron got almost instantly stoned—it was clear that she wasn’t\\ninterested in me at all. But the party went on nevertheless, and at one point\\nwe were all playing a game—Pictionary, I think. As she was drawing, I said\\nsomething witty to Cameron, to which she said, “Oh, come on!” and\\nproceeded to punch me in the shoulder.\\nOr, at least, that’s what she meant to do. But she missed and, instead,\\npunched me smack in the side of my face.\\n“Are you fucking kidding me?” I said, realizing I’d just been punched in\\nthe face by Cameron Diaz and my big arms hadn’t helped at all.\\nThis was about fifteen years ago. But she’ll probably call me. Don’t you\\nthink?\\nThen there was this other time.\\nIn 2004, I flew out to Chris Evert’s tennis academy in Florida for a\\ncharity event, the Chris Evert / Bank of America Pro-Celebrity Tennis\\nClassic. It was a veritable who’s who in Hollywood. But I was mostinterested in Chevy Chase.\\nChevy had long been a hero of mine. In fact, his performance in the\\nmovie \\nFletch\\n had changed my life forever. One chilly night in LA, my best\\nbuddy Matt Ondre and I went to see a preview screening of \\nFletch,\\n and at one\\npoint, we were literally rolling in the aisles with laughter. Chevy must have\\nhad three hundred jokes in that movie, and he landed each one perfectly.\\nLater, as Matt and I sat at the bus stop awaiting our ride home, I vividly\\nremember turning to him and very seriously saying, “Matt, I am going to talk\\nthat way for the rest of my life.” And I have. Which makes this next story\\nparticularly painful for both Chevy and me.\\nPossibly more for Chevy.\\nAnyway, at the charity ball the night before the tennis event, Chevy\\nwalked up to me and said, “I just want you to know I’m a big fan.” This was\\nincredible.\\nI said, “Oh my God, all I do is steal from you,” and we went on to have a\\nmutually complimentary and quite lovely conversation.\\nNext day, it was time to play tennis.\\nNow, my skills were by this point admittedly rusty. I hadn’t played in\\nyears, and my ground strokes needed a lot of work. What I did have, though,\\nwas an incredibly hard serve—in fact, they had a speed clock at the\\ntournament, and I punched in at 111 miles per hour. The only problem was, I\\nwas not exactly sure where they were going. Which was fine at your\\neveryday public court, not so fine in front of two thousand people. Even\\nformer president George H. W. Bush was there.…\\nThe game begins. I am first up to serve. I have my partner in the ad court,\\nand on the opposite side is Chevy, also in the ad court near the net, and his\\npartner back at the baseline, to whom I would be serving directly. I toss up\\nthe ball, bring my racket around my back, hammer the tennis ball as hard as\\npossible, and watch in horror as instead of it spearing across court to Chevy’s\\npartner, it goes directly straight, and it’s heading for Chevy Chase. He is\\nstanding on the service line, which is exactly sixty feet from where I’ve hit\\nthe ball. This line is, coincidentally, the exact distance from the mound to\\nhome plate in baseball, so I can confidently tell you that if the ball was hit at\\nabout 100 miles per hour, this means it was traveling at about 146.7 feet persecond, meaning Mr. Chase had 0.412 seconds to get out of the way.\\nMr. Chase did not get out of the way.\\nMore precisely, his testicles didn’t get out of the way—I have just served\\nsomething close to a professional-speed serve right into his Chevy Chases. If\\nyou know what I mean.\\nHere’s what happened next: Chevy made a funny face—just like the one\\nhe makes in \\nFletch\\n when a doctor gives him a prostate exam—and then\\ndropped to the ground. (Remember, all this was going down in front of two\\nthousand people.)\\nEvent now over, it took four medics to dash onto the court, strap him to a\\ngurney, and rush him to the nearest hospital.\\nIf this is what I do to my heroes, Michael Keaton and Steve Martin better\\ntake cover.\\nAnd thus concludes the violent section of this book.10\\nThe Big Terrible Thing\\nImagine this: you have to walk back onto a set where you have almost\\nliterally shat the bed for weeks before. You’ve been out of it, slurring lines,\\nmaking bad decisions. You’re in New York City, and even though you have\\nnot one but two sober companions, you call room service at the hotel, your\\nvoice shaking, detoxing, and say, “Please put a bottle of vodka in the bathtub\\nof my room. Yes, the bathtub. Hide it in there.”\\nAnd then, when the day is done, you head back to that fucking hotel\\nroom, and you drink the bottle of vodka, and you finally feel all right again\\nfor maybe three hours and then have to do it all over again the next day.\\nYou’re shaking, pretending that you are not in very serious trouble whenever\\nyou talk to anyone. Using that same shaky voice, you call the hotel and tell\\nthem to do the vodka-bottle-in-the-bathtub thing again.\\nThis is perhaps something that a “normy”—what we addicts call all you\\nlucky nonalcoholics—might always struggle to understand. I’ll take a stab at\\nexplaining it: when you drink an entire bottle of vodka, you are extremely\\nsick the following day. Having a few drinks in the morning helps, but I was\\nthe lead in a giant studio movie, so I could not drink in the morning. You are\\nsick and trembling, and it feels like \\nevery part of your insides is trying to\\nsqueeze out of your body. And that’s all day—the entire fourteen-hour day.\\nThe only way to fix how sick you are is to drink the exact same amount,\\nor a little more, the following night. “So just don’t drink,” says the normy.\\nWe alcoholics feel like we will literally go insane if we don’t drink—not to\\nmention the alcoholic will be even sicker, and \\nlook\\n sicker, if he doesn’t drink\\nthe bottle.“But what about the movie?”\\nDoesn’t matter—I have to drink.\\n“How about taking a break for the night?”\\nNot possible.\\nNext question?\\nSo, I’m in Dallas—I am on methadone, a quart of vodka a day, cocaine,\\nand Xanax. Every day I would show up to set, pass out in my chair, wake up\\nto do a scene, stumble to set, then just basically scream into a camera for two\\nminutes. Then it was back to my chair for further nap time.\\nAt this point in my life, I was one of the most famous people in the world\\n—in fact, I was being burned by the white-hot flame of fame. Therefore, no\\none dared to say anything about this horrific behavior. The movie people\\nwanted the film to be completed, slap my name on a poster, and make $60\\nmillion. And \\nFriends …\\n well \\nFriends\\n was even worse—no one wanted to\\nmess with that moneymaking machine.\\nAt one point during the filming of \\nServing Sara\\n I thought maybe some\\nValium would help me somehow. A doctor arrived at my duplex hotel room\\nto give me some. The night before he came to visit, I had drunk a party-size\\nbottle of vodka, the one with the handle on it. When the doctor looked around\\nthe room, he saw the bottle and said, in a nervous voice, “Did you drink all of\\nthat?”\\n“Yes,” I said, “may I have the Valium every four hours, not every six?”\\nWith that, he turned tail and ran top speed down the spiral staircase \\nand\\nout the door, presumably so he wouldn’t actually be in the room if Matthew\\nPerry died.\\nBut I went away to rehab after Jamie Tarses had told me I was\\ndisappearing, and eventually came back to finish the movie.\\nThis was me during \\nServing Sara.\\n I was a mess. I felt so guilty, and I\\napologized to everybody, and I like to think that I did a great job for the final\\nthirteen days of shooting. Everyone tried to be kind about it, and they were\\ndoing their best, but they were pissed off; the director was pissed off—I’d\\nruined his movie; Elizabeth Hurley, my costar, was pissed off (she never got\\nto do another movie, either).\\nI needed to make real amends—that’s part of what AA teaches you. So, Irerecorded my slurred parts for the entire movie—which meant I looped the\\nentire movie—days and days in a sound studio. Three beeps in a studio and\\nI’d say my line to match my mouth. I happen to be good at that, and at the\\nvery least we got the slurring out of the movie. Then I committed to doing the\\nmost press possible in the history of press, bending over backward to make\\nthings right. I was on the cover of everything, on every talk show you can\\nthink of.\\nOf course, the movie tanked anyway. I was paid $3.5 million to do the\\nmovie and I got sued for the shutdown, even though it was a health issue. At\\nthe mediation table a team of insurance flacks faced me down, so I just wrote\\nthem a check for $650,000.\\nI remember thinking, \\nMan, no one taught me the rules of life.\\n I was a\\ncomplete mess of a person—selfish and narcissistic. Everything had to be\\nabout me, and I matched that with a really handy inferiority complex, an\\nalmost fatal combo. I was all about myself from the time I was ten years old,\\nfrom that moment when I looked around and said, \\nIt’s every man for himself.\\nI had to be so focused on me just to keep myself together.\\nBut AA will teach you this is no way to live.\\nOne of the things you do in the 12 steps of AA is create a personal moral\\ninventory (it’s the fourth step). In it, you write down all the \\npeople that\\nyou’re mad at and why. (I had sixty-eight names—sixty-eight!) Then you\\nwrite down how it has affected you, and then you read it to someone (this is\\nstep five).\\nWhat I learned from this process—and by the care and love of a great\\nsponsor to whom I read my list—was that I wasn’t the center of the universe.\\nIt’s kind of a relief learning that. There were other people around who had\\nneeds and cares and were just as important as I was.\\n(If you’re shaking your head now, go on, have at it. Let he who is without\\nsin cast the first stone.)\\nSobriety had now become the most important thing in my life. Because I\\nlearned that if you put anything in front of sobriety, you will lose that\\n“anything” anyway if you drink.\\nI read my list to my sponsor one beautiful spring day at a wonderful\\nmeditation center in Los Angeles called the Self-Realization Fellowship LakeShrine. Perched on a hill overlooking the Pacific, the place is truly peaceful—\\nthere’s a lake and gardens and temples and even a pot of some of Mahatma\\nGandhi’s ashes, the only such stash outside of India.\\nAs I finished reading out my list, we realized a wedding was starting in\\nthe gardens. I watched as the couple beamed at each other, the families in\\ntheir best attire, an officiant smiling, waiting to warble on about sickness and\\nhealth till death do they part. I hadn’t been there for anyone for so long, my\\naddiction being my best friend and my evil friend and my punisher and my\\nlover, all in one. My big terrible thing. But that day, up there with the view—\\nthere always has to be a view, of course—and with the soon-to-be\\nnewlyweds, and Gandhi somewhere nearby, I sensed an awakening, that I\\nwas here for more than this big terrible thing. That I could help people, love\\nthem, because of how far down the scale I had gone, I had a story to tell, a\\nstory that could really help people. And helping others had become the\\nanswer for me.\\nOn July 19, 2019, the front page of \\nThe New York Times\\n featured stories\\nabout Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels, a deadly arson at a Kyoto animation\\nstudio, and Puerto Ricans who, according to the headline, had “had enough.”\\nI knew none of this. Nor would I know anything for the next two weeks:\\nnot that El Chapo got life plus thirty years; not that some nineteen-year-old\\nshot three people dead (and himself) at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California;\\nnot that Boris Johnson became the UK prime minister.\\nWhen I awoke from my coma, I was screaming. My mother was there. I\\nasked her what had happened. She told me my colon had exploded.\\n“It’s amazing that you’re alive,” she said. “Your resiliency is incredible.\\nAnd with some life changes, you’re gonna be OK. And they can remove the\\ncolostomy bag in about nine months.”\\nI thought, \\nI have a colostomy bag? That’s great. Girls find that to be a\\ndefinite turn-on.\\nI said, “Thank you very much.”\\nAfter that I rolled over, and really didn’t talk or move for two weeks. I\\nhad been inches from death because of something that I had done. I wasattached to fifty machines, and I would have to learn to walk again.\\nI hated myself. I had almost killed myself. The shame, the loneliness, the\\nregret, were too much to handle. I just lay there, trying to deal with all of it,\\nbut there was no dealing with it. It had already been done. I was afraid to die,\\nwhich was in direct opposition to my actions.\\nBut it was over. \\nThe Matthew Perry Show,\\n canceled by opiates.\\nSometimes I could sort of pay attention to what was going on in the room,\\nbut that was about it. I certainly wasn’t taking part in anything. My best\\nfriends, Chris and Brian Murray, would come visit. About three weeks into it,\\nMaria, my sister on my father’s side, came to see me.\\n“Are you ready to hear what happened?” she said.\\nI nodded (barely).\\n“After your colon exploded, they put you on a ventilator, which you\\nvomited into. So, all of this bile and septic shit went into your lungs. They\\nput you on an ECMO machine—somehow you survived that. And you were\\nin a coma for fourteen days.”\\nAfter that, I don’t think I spoke for another week because I had realized\\nthat my greatest fear had come true, which is that I did this to myself. There\\nwas one upside, though. A fourteen-day coma makes it very simple to quit\\nsmoking.\\nI had been on opiates, and off opiates, and back on different opiates for so\\nlong that I suffered from a situation that only a subset of the population gets.\\nOpiates cause constipation. It’s kind of poetic. I was so full of shit it almost\\nkilled me.\\nAlso, I now had a bowel situation.\\nThe last thing I’d said to Erin before the coma, as I was spinning on the\\nground in Pain, right before I lost consciousness, was, “Don’t leave me.” I\\nmeant right then and there, but she, like the rest of my friends and family,\\ntook it literally. Erin pulled the night shift for five months in that hospital.\\nI often look back on that time and am so grateful that this happened\\nbefore Covid, because then I would have been alone in that room for five\\nmonths. As it was, I was never alone in that room once. That was God’s love,\\nin human form, made flesh.Both my mom and I are experts in a crisis now. What I’ve always wanted to\\ntell her is that the little show called \\nFriends,\\n and all the other shows, and\\nmovies? I essentially did it all for her attention. And yet that’s the one person\\nwhose attention I did not really get from \\nFriends.\\n She mentioned it on\\noccasion, but she was never boiling with pride about what her son had\\naccomplished.\\nBut I don’t think there’s possibly a way that she could have been proud\\nenough for what I needed. And if you’re going to blame your parents for the\\nbad stuff, you also have to give them credit for the good stuff. \\nAll\\n the good\\nstuff. I could never have played Chandler if my mother weren’t my mother. I\\nwould never have made $80 million if my mother weren’t my mother.\\nBecause Chandler was just a hider of true pain. What better character for a\\nsitcom! To just make a joke about everything, so we don’t have to talk about\\nanything real—that’s how Chandler started. In the initial breakdown of the\\nshow, Chandler was supposed to be “an observer of other people’s lives.” So,\\nhe would be the guy who at the end of a scene would make some joke,\\ncomment on whatever has just happened—the Fool in \\nKing Lear,\\n speaking\\ntruth where there had been none. But everyone ended up liking Chandler so\\nmuch that he morphed into being his own major character. That he ended up\\nsuperseding what I actually did in real life—getting married, having kids—\\nwell … some things I can’t talk about all that well.\\nThe bottom line is, I abandoned my mother, at fifteen, just as she’d been\\nabandoned by my father. I was not an easy child to put up with, and she was\\njust a child herself. She always did her best and was with me in my hospital\\nroom for five months after the coma.\\nWhen your colon explodes because of overuse of opiates, the prudent thing to\\ndo is to not ask for opiates to solve the situation … which is, of course, what I\\ndid.\\nAnd they gave them to me.\\nI was impossibly depressed and as always wanted to feel better. Also the\\nhole in my stomach, the one that you could fit a bowling ball in, was ampleexcuse to get pain medication. Just so you are following along, I had come\\nwithin inches of dying because of opiates and I asked \\nthe doctors to solve that\\nproblem with … opiates! So no, even after the catastrophic event, I was not\\ndone. I hadn’t learned anything. I still wanted to use.\\nWhen I got out of the hospital after the explosion, I was actually looking\\nreally good. I’d lost a lot of weight, but I was so injured that they couldn’t do\\nsurgery to replace the bag for at least another nine months. So, I went home\\nto my apartment, lied to everyone about the severity of the pain to get pain\\nmedication. I was not actually in pain. It was more annoyance than pain. But\\ndoctors believed the lie and gave me tons of opiates, and obviously I started\\nsmoking again.\\nAnd that was kind of my life.\\nAnd let’s not forget: that colostomy bag was constantly breaking,\\nregularly—fifty times at least—leaving me with shit all over me.\\nDear Colostomy Bag People: make a bag that doesn’t break, you fucking\\nmorons. Did I make you laugh on \\nFriends\\n? If so, don’t put shit all over my\\nface.\\nWhen an addict takes a pill, they feel euphoric. But after a short while the\\npill doesn’t make them euphoric anymore because a tolerance has built up.\\nBut the addict still really, really wants to feel euphoric again, so they take two\\ninstead to get the feeling that one originally gave them.\\nThen, two is not enough, and they go to three.\\nIn the past, I had played that little game until the number got up to fifty-\\nfive pills a day. (Just watch the second half of season three of \\nFriends.\\n I was\\nso frail and skinny and sick. It definitely showed, but no one said anything\\nabout it.)\\nThe UCLA hospital was giving me opiates for my fake stomach pain, but\\nI needed more, so I called a drug dealer. But I was on the fortieth floor of that\\nbuilding in Century City, and that meant that I had to figure out a way to go\\ndown forty floors, give the dealer the money in an empty cigarette packet,\\nand get my pills. Then I had to get back \\nto the fortieth floor unnoticed, take\\nthe pills, and I would get to feel good for a while.\\nNow, I had to do this with a sober companion, a nurse, and Erin all living\\nin the apartment. Turns out I was terrible at it—I tried four times and gotcaught exactly four times. The UCLA doctors were not pleased with this and\\nsaid I had to go to rehab.\\nI had no choice—I was addicted to everything they gave me. Had I just\\nsaid, “No, fuck off,” it might have been a glorious moment, but then the\\ndrugs would stop, and I would get crazy sick. I was put in the rather strange\\nposition of choosing where I’d be locked up for months—given the choice of\\nNew York or Houston. Maybe somebody more capable than me should be\\ngiven that decision? I, being the least qualified to make any decisions, picked\\nNew York.\\nI was high as a kite and fakely clutching my stomach when we arrived at\\nthe recovery center in New York. Even though the place resembled a prison,\\nthe people in there were all smiles.\\n“What the fuck are you guys so \\nhappy\\n about?” I said. (I had a tendency to\\nbe a bit grumpy.) I was on 14 milligrams of Ativan and 60 milligrams of\\nOxyContin. I had a colostomy bag. I asked where I could smoke and was told\\nthere would be no smoking here.\\n“I can’t stay here if I can’t smoke,” I said.\\n“Well, you can’t smoke here.”\\n“Yeah, I heard what you said. How in the world am I supposed to quit\\nsmoking on top of everything else?”\\n“We’ll give you a patch.”\\n“Don’t blame me if I smoke the actual fucking patch,” I said.\\nIt was agreed that they would keep me on the Ativan, put me on\\nSuboxone, and I could smoke during the detox, but not when I was on the\\nmain unit. This meant that I could smoke for four more days. When I wanted\\nto smoke, the staff member would escort me outside and stand next to me\\nwhile I puffed away.\\nThat was relaxing.\\nThree nights went by, and then I met a very pretty, extremely smart nurse.\\nShe took very good care of me, and I flirted with her as much as you can flirt\\nwith someone who is changing your colostomy bag on the reg. The dreaded\\nday where I would have to quit smoking was looming, so I was allowed to\\nwalk out with the wonderful nurse to get coffee. Accordingly, my mood lifted\\na bit. I made jokes, I flirted, in that “we’re all in rehab so nothing-can-really-happen” way, and we returned.\\nBack at the center, the nurse said, “I need you to do something for me.”\\n“Whatever you need,” I said.\\n“I need you to stop trying to fuck the hot nurse.”\\nShe was referring to herself.\\nJesus.\\n“I thought we were both flirting in a safe, never-going-to-happen way,” I\\nsaid.\\nI was there for four more months, and I never flirted with her again. Nor\\ndid she flirt back at my nonflirting, perhaps because she’d seen me covered in\\nmy own shit multiple times.\\nI moved up to the unit, met therapists—Bruce, Wendy, whatever—whom\\nI wanted nothing to do with. All I wanted to do was smoke. Or talk about\\nsmoking. Or smoke while talking about smoking.\\nEveryone just looked like a giant cigarette.\\nI rarely left my room. The bag kept breaking. I called my mother and I\\nasked her to come save me. She said that I would smoke if I left and that\\nwould be awful for the coming surgery. I called my therapist, begged her to\\nget me out. She said the same thing my mom had.\\nI was fucked and stuck.\\nPanic set in. My bag was full. I was not high. There was nothing\\nseparating me from me. I felt like a little kid scared of monsters in the dark.\\nBut was \\nI\\n the monster?\\nI found that stairwell. The nurse? Nowhere to be found. Therapy? Fuck\\ntherapy. I hit those walls with my head just as hard as Jimmy Connors used to\\nhit his forehands down the line. Lots of topspin. Right on the fucking line.\\nStairwells.\\nI’m this close to dying every day.\\nI don’t have another sobriety in me. If I went out, I would never be able\\nto come back. And if I went out, I would go out hard. I would have to go out\\nhard because my tolerance is so high.\\nIt’s not like the Amy Winehouse story, where she was sober for a while,and then the first drinks she had killed her. She said something in that\\ndocumentary that is true for me, too. She had just won a Grammy and she\\nsaid to a friend, “I can’t enjoy this unless I’m drunk.”\\nThe idea of being famous, the idea of being rich, the idea of being me—I\\ncan’t enjoy any of it unless I’m high. And I can’t think of love without\\nwanting to be high. I lack a spiritual connection that protects me from these\\nfeelings. That’s why I’m a seeker.\\nThe first time I reached fifty-five pills a day, like the character of Betsy\\nMallum in \\nDopesick,\\n I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t know that I\\nwas addicted. I’m one of the first famous people who went to rehab and\\npeople \\nknew\\n about it. In 1997, I was on the number one TV show in America\\nand went to rehab and it was on the cover of the magazines. But I had no idea\\nwhat was happening to me. Betsy Mallum in \\nDopesick\\n graduates to heroin,\\nand it’s sayonara—you see her just kind of nod out, smile, and die. But that\\nsmile is the feeling that I want all the time. She must have felt so good, but it\\nkilled\\n her. But that beatific moment is something I still seek, only without the\\ndeath part. I want a connection. I want that connection to something bigger\\nthan me because I’m convinced it’s the only thing that will truly save my life.\\nI don’t want to die. I’m scared to die.\\nI’m not even any good at finding the drugs. Somebody at one point that I\\nworked with introduced me to a crooked doctor. I would claim that I had\\nmigraine headaches—actually, I had maybe eight doctors going for my made-\\nup migraines—and I would still sit through a forty-five-minute MRI to get\\ndrugs. Sometimes, when things were really bad, I’d go to drug dealer houses.\\nThe nurse of the doctor took over from him when he died. She had all the\\npills, and she lived in the Valley, and whenever I wanted to get pills, I would\\ngo see her. I’d be terrified the entire time.\\nShe’d say, “Come in!”\\n“No!” I’d shout, “we’re going to get arrested. Just take the money and let\\nme get outta here.”\\nLater she wanted me to sit and do coke with her. I’d get the pills, and\\nbecause I was so terrified, I’d take three instantly and drive home and be high\\nto take the edge off the fear, which just meant I was even more arrestable.\\nMuch later, when I lived in Century City, I’d try to find excuses to godown forty stories to score. I was so sick and so injured at the time—my\\nstomach hadn’t closed yet, I was alone during Covid … I had a nurse on staff\\ngiving me drugs, but I wasn’t getting high from them anymore. So I would\\ncall a drug dealer and get more Oxy. This way, I’d have additional drugs to\\nthe ones I’d been prescribed so that I could actually feel them. The street pills\\nwere something like $75 per pill, so I was giving the guy $3,000 at a time,\\nmany times a week.\\nBut I got caught more times than I was able to pull it off. The UCLA\\ndoctor in charge of my case got fed up with me and told me he wouldn’t help\\nme anymore. I couldn’t really blame him—everybody was terrified about\\nfentanyl being in the pills and me dying from them. (When I got to the\\ntreatment center, sure enough, I tested positive for fentanyl.)\\nThis disease … the big horrible thing. Addiction has ruined so much of\\nmy life it’s not funny. It’s ruined relationships. It’s ruined the day-to-day\\nprocess of being me. I have a friend who doesn’t have any money, lives in a\\nrent-controlled apartment. Never made it as an actor, has diabetes, is\\nconstantly worried about money, doesn’t work. And I would trade places\\nwith him in a second. In fact, I would give up all the money, all the fame, all\\nthe stuff, to live in a rent-controlled apartment—I’d trade being worried about\\nmoney all the time to not have this disease, this addiction.\\nAnd not only do I have the disease, but I also have it \\nbad\\n. I have it as bad\\nas you can have it, in fact. It’s backs-to-the-wall time all the time. It’s going\\nto kill me (I guess something has to). Robert Downey Jr., talking about his\\nown addiction, once said, “It’s like I have a gun in my mouth with my finger\\non the trigger, and I like the taste of the metal.” I got it; I understand that.\\nEven on good days, when I’m sober and I’m looking forward, it’s still with\\nme all the time. There’s still a gun.\\nFortunately, I guess, there’s not enough opiates in the world to make me\\nhigh anymore. I have a very, very, very low bottom. Things have to get truly\\nawful—they have to get big, and terrible—before I quit anything. When I\\nwas doing the show \\nMr. Sunshine,\\n I was basically running it—writing it,\\nstarring in it. Then, at home, I was working on notes for a writer on a script\\nthat he had written. I had a bottle of vodka next to me. I made myself\\nthirteen, fourteen drinks—but homemade drinks, so \\ntriples.\\n And after thefourteenth drink, I wasn’t drunk anymore. So, I quit drinking.\\nI think now I’m at the point with opiates where it’s the same situation.\\nThere are just not enough. I took 1,800 milligrams of opiates in Switzerland\\nper day and wasn’t high. So, what am I gonna do? Call a drug dealer and ask\\nfor \\nall\\n the drugs? Now when I think about OxyContin, my mind flashes\\ndirectly to having a colostomy bag for life. Which is something I could not\\nhandle. That’s why I think it’ll be \\npretty easy for me to continue being off\\nopiates—they don’t work anymore. And I could wake up from another\\nsurgery—there have already been fourteen since the first one—with an\\nirreversible colostomy bag.\\nIt’s time to figure something else out. (As said, the next level is heroin,\\nand I won’t go there.) Me quitting drinking and opiates doesn’t have anything\\nto do with strength, by the way—it just doesn’t work anymore. If somebody\\ncame into my house right now and said, “Here’s a hundred milligrams of\\nOxy,” I’d say, “It’s not enough.”\\nThe problem remains, though: \\nI’m\\n there wherever I go. I bring along the\\nproblems and the darkness and the shit, so every time I leave a rehab, I do a\\ngeographic and buy a new fucking house. And then I live in it.\\nAnd the first thing I used to do when I looked at houses—which is a\\nhobby of mine—was go through the homeowners’ medicine cabinets to see if\\nthey had any pills I could purloin. You can’t be a dick about it, though—you\\nhave to take the right amount. You can’t take too many or they’ll know for\\nsure. So, you check the date on the pill bottle—you want something that’s\\nsort of out-of-date. If it’s been a \\nlong\\n time out-of-date, you could take a\\nbunch of them. But if it’s brand-new, you could take only a couple. I would\\nhit five open houses on a Sunday—that’d be my whole day.\\nAt one point, when I was taking fifty-five a day, I would wake up and\\nsomehow have to find those fifty-five pills. It was like a full-time job. My\\nwhole life was math. I need eight to get home; then I’ll be there for three\\nhours. So I need four more. And then I have to go to that dinner party. So I\\nneed seven for that.… And all this to just maintain, to not be sick, to avoid\\nthe inevitable, which is the detox.\\nI imagine those homeowners arriving back after their open house and\\neventually, at some point, opening their medicine cabinet.“Is it possible that Chandler … no, not \\nChandler.\\n Surely not Chandler\\nBing\\n!”\\nNow, instead of open houses, I’m having one built. I started the process\\nbecause about eighteen months ago, I couldn’t complete a sentence. Things\\ngot so flat, so awful for me. Doctors came in, my mother came in, everybody\\ncame in and took care of me because I couldn’t talk. I was so out of it. I had\\nto do something.\\nI had that $20 million penthouse apartment in Century City, where I was\\ndoing drugs and watching TV and having sex with my girlfriend of a few\\nmonths.\\nOne night I was passed out and she was passed out and when we woke up\\nmy mother and Keith Morrison were at the foot of my bed. I thought, \\nAm I in\\nan episode of\\n Dateline\\n? And if I\\n am\\n, why is my\\n mother \\nalso in it?\\nMy mother looked at my girlfriend and said, “I think it’s time for you to\\nleave.”\\nThis saved my life.\\nMy dad has saved my life multiple times, too.\\nWhen he helped me get to Marina del Rey (after Jamie Tarses had told\\nme I was disappearing before her very eyes), I was deathly afraid that I would\\nnever have fun again for the rest of my life. After about three weeks, I called\\nMarta Kauffman and David Crane to tell them I was sober and could return to\\nFriends\\n.\\n“When are you coming back?” they said. “We need you to come back.\\nIt’s going to be very work intensive. We have to start in two weeks, or we\\nwon’t be able to do it.”\\nBut I was still very sick. My father had overheard the tenor of the\\nconversation and called Marta and David back.\\n“I will pull him off your television show,” Dad said, “if you continue to\\nact this way around him.”\\nI was so grateful for him for being my dad and doing the dad thing, \\nbut I\\nalso didn’t want to be the problem. They were just doing their job; they had\\nthe number one hit TV show, and two of the main characters were about toget married. I couldn’t just disappear. I just wanted everything to be OK. So,\\nthen I was moved from Marina del Rey to Promises, in Malibu, and was told\\nI was going to need more than twenty-eight days—I would need \\nmonths\\n to\\nget better from this.\\nTwo weeks later, I was driven to the set of \\nFriends\\n by a technician from\\nMalibu. When I arrived, Jen Aniston said, “I’ve been \\nmad\\n at you.”\\n“Honey,” I said, “if you knew what I’d been through, you would \\nnot\\n be\\nmad at me.”\\nWith that we hugged, and I got the work done. I married Monica and got\\ndriven back to the treatment center—at the height of my highest point in\\nFriends,\\n the highest point in my career, the iconic moment on the iconic\\nshow—in a pickup truck helmed by a sober technician.\\nNot all the lights were green on Sunset that night, let me tell ya.\\nI can’t be useful in a relationship because I’m both trying to hang on and in\\nso much fear that I’ll be left. And that fear is not even real, because in my\\nfifty-three years, and with all the wonderful girlfriends I’ve had, I’ve only\\nbeen left once, many years back. You would think this would be outweighed\\nby all the others I left … yet she was everything to me. The smart man in me\\nsees it clearly, though: she was only twenty-five, just trying to have a good\\ntime; we dated for a few months, but I let all my walls down. I decided once\\nand for all to just be myself.\\nAnd then she dumped me.\\nShe had never promised me anything. I was drinking like a maniac, too,\\nand I don’t blame her.\\nI had to see her at a play reading a couple of years ago—she played my\\nwife.\\n“How are you?” she said before the reading, and I pretended I was \\nfine,\\nbut I was in hell. \\nGet out of there, do not engage,\\n I thought, \\njust pretend\\neverything’s OK.\\n“I have a couple of kids with my partner now,” she said, “and life is good.\\nAre you with anybody?”\\n“No,” I said, “I’m still looking.”I wish I hadn’t said that because it made it sound like I was still looking\\never since she dumped me. But it’s true. I’m still looking.\\nThen the play reading ended, and she was no longer my wife, and I got\\nthe hell out of there, and she still looked exactly the same.\\nThese days, I have faith in God, but too often that faith seems, well, \\nblocked.\\nBut then, everything is blocked by the medication I’m on.\\nThese days, too, I ask this question: Am I blocking my relationship with a\\nhigher power by taking Suboxone?\\nOne of my big problems, and the reason that I’ve had so much trouble\\ngetting sober over the years, is I’ve never let myself feel uncomfortable long\\nenough to have a spiritual connection. So, I fix it with pills and alcohol\\nbefore God can jump in and fix \\nme.\\nI did a breath work class recently. For half an hour you breathe in this\\nvery intense, very uncomfortable way. You cry, you see things, you kinda\\nfeel high. For me it’s a freebie high, the best kind. But the Suboxone even\\nblocks \\nthat\\n feeling.… Half the doctors I speak to say I should be on\\nSuboxone for at least a year, but probably the rest of my life. Other doctors\\ntell me I’m not technically sober while I’m still on it. (It’s very difficult to get\\nall the way off it either way, which is ironic because it’s a drug used to get\\nyou off \\nother\\n drugs. Recently, when I was hooked up to an IV of it, the\\ndosage I was receiving was 0.5 lower than it was supposed to be, and it got\\nme so sick and scared I had to bump it back up. You feel terrible when you\\nstop taking it.)\\nWhen you take heroin, the drug hits your opiate receptors, and \\nthen you\\nare high, and then it fades and you’re not hitting the opiate receptors\\nanymore, then you’re sober for a while, and then maybe the next day you hit\\nyour opiate receptors again, and then you’re high, and on and on. But\\nSuboxone works differently, wrapping itself around the receptor, and it\\ndoesn’t go away, which means it’s basically damaging your receptors 24/7.\\nSo, one of the theories that I have about my struggle with \\nhappiness\\n is\\nthat I’ve damaged these receptors. My dopamine gets replaced by the\\nSuboxone. The dopamine hit is what you get when you enjoy something, likelooking at a sunset, or playing tennis and you make a good shot, or you hear a\\nsong you love. But I’m pretty sure my opiate receptors are very seriously\\ndamaged, possibly to the point of no return. That’s why I’m always a little\\nbummed.\\nJust like pancreatitis, maybe if I left my opioid receptors alone for an\\nextended period they’d fix themselves and I’d be happy again.\\nI’ve seen God in my kitchen, of all places, so I know there’s something\\nbigger than me. (I know I can’t make a plant, for a start.) I know it’s an\\nomnipresent love and acceptance that means that everything’s going to be\\nOK. I know something happens when you die. I know you move on to\\nsomething wonderful.\\nAlcoholics and addicts like myself want to drink for the sole purpose of\\nfeeling better. Well, that’s at least true for me: all I ever wanted was to feel\\nbetter. I didn’t feel good—I had a couple of drinks and I felt better. But as the\\ndisease progresses it takes more and more and more and more and more and\\nmore and more to feel better. If you puncture the membrane of sobriety,\\nalcoholism kicks in and goes, “Hey, remember me? Nice to see you again.\\nNow, give me just as much as you did last time or I’ll kill you or make you\\ncrazy.” And then the obsession of my mind kicks in, and I can’t stop thinking\\nabout feeling better, \\nmatched with a phenomenon of craving, and what you’re\\nleft with is a bruise that starts off one way and it never gets better. Nobody\\nhas a drinking problem and then stops and then drinks socially and it’s fine.\\nThe disease just picks up.\\nThe Big Book says that alcohol is cunning, baffling, and powerful … but\\nI would also add that it’s \\npatient.\\n As soon as you raise your hand and say,\\n“I’m having a problem,” it’s as though addiction says, “Well, if you’re going\\nto be so \\nstupid\\n as to say something about it, I’ll go away for a while.…” I’ll\\nbe in a rehab for three months and think, \\nWell, I’m going to use when I get\\nout of here, but I can wait for nine more to days to do it.\\n The disease is just\\ndrumming its fingers. In AA it’s often said that when you’re in a meeting,\\nyour disease is doing one-armed push-ups outside, just waiting for you to\\nleave.I’ve almost died several times, and the lower you get down the scale\\n(death is as low as it goes, FYI), the more people you can help. So, when my\\nlife is firing on all cylinders, I have folks I sponsor, people calling me to help\\nthem with their lives. The two years from 2001 to 2003 were two of the\\nhappiest of my life—I was helping people, sober, strong.\\nThere were other good side effects of sobriety. I was also single for some\\nof it. So I’d go to clubs, but I didn’t want to drink—the miracle had happened\\nfor me. And let me tell you, no one is more popular at 2:00 \\nA.M.\\n in a club than\\na sober guy who says, “Hi, how are you?” to a woman. I don’t think I’ve ever\\ngotten laid more than those two years.\\nBut the disease is patient. You slowly stop going to all the meetings\\nyou’re supposed to go to. \\nI don’t really need to go to the one on a Friday\\nnight…! And then, by the time you’re deep into that kind of thinking,\\nalcoholism is coming for you, baffling and powerful and patient. Suddenly,\\nyou’re not going to any meetings anymore. And you’ve convinced yourself\\nthat you understand it all. \\nNow I don’t need to do this anymore. I\\n get \\nit.\\nAddicts are not bad people. We’re just people who are trying to \\nfeel\\nbetter, but we have this disease. When I feel bad, I think, \\nGive me something\\nthat makes me feel better.\\n It’s as simple as that. I would still love to drink and\\ntake drugs, but because of the consequences, I don’t, because I’m so late\\nstage that it would kill me.\\nRecently my mother told me she was proud of me. I’d written a movie and\\nshe’d read it. I’d been wanting her to say that my whole life.\\nWhen I pointed this out, she said, “What about a little forgiveness?”\\n“I \\ndo\\n forgive you,” I said. “I \\ndo.\\n”\\nI wonder if she can forgive me for everything I’ve put her through.…\\nIf a selfish, lazy fuck like myself can change, then anyone can. No secret gets\\nworse just because it has been told. At this point in my life, the words of\\ngratitude pour out of me because I should be dead, and yet somehow I amnot. There must be a reason for that. It’s simply too hard for me to understand\\nif there isn’t.\\nI don’t believe in half-assing things anymore. The path of least resistance\\nis boring, and scars are interesting—they tell an honest story, and they are\\nproof that a battle was fought, and in my case, hard-won.\\nI have many scars now.\\nThe first time I took my shirt off in my bathroom after returning from the\\nhospital after my first surgery I burst into tears. I was so disturbed by it. I\\nthought my life was over. After about half an hour I got my shit together\\nenough to call my drug dealer, who proceeded to ask me what was wrong,\\nlike he was a social worker or a priest, not a drug dealer.\\nThree days ago, I had my fourteenth surgery—it’s four years later. I cried\\nagain. I should learn to get used to it, though, because there will always be\\nmore surgeries—I will never be done. I will always have the \\nbowels of a man\\nin his nineties. In fact, I have never not cried after a surgery. Not once.\\nI’ve stopped calling the drug dealers, though.\\nThere are so many scars on my stomach that all I need to do is look down\\nto know that I’ve been through a war, a self-inflicted war. Once, at some\\nHollywood function—shirts allowed, nay, \\ninsisted\\n on, in fact, thank God—\\nMartin Sheen turned to me and said, “Do you know what Saint Peter says to\\neveryone who tries to get into heaven?” When I looked blankly, the man who\\nonce was president said, “Peter says, ‘Don’t you have any scars?’ And when\\nmost would respond proudly, ‘Well no, no I don’t,’ Peter says, ‘Why not?\\nWas there nothing worth fighting for?’”\\n(Martin Sheen, like Pacino, Sean Penn, Ellen DeGeneres, Kevin Bacon,\\nChevy Chase, Robert De Niro—these are all fellow members of the “Famous\\nClub” I’ve encountered, an informal little thing you join when you’re in an\\nairport or at a function and someone also famous comes up and says hi like\\nwe know each other.)\\nThe scars, though, the scars … my stomach looks like a topographical\\nmap of China. And they fucking \\nhurt\\n. Sadly, these days my body just laughs\\nat 30 milligrams of OxyContin. Oral meds don’t work at all; the only thing\\nthat helps a little bit is IV medication, and I obviously can’t take that at home,\\nso off I go, back to the hospital.In January 2022, I’d had a six-inch incision with metal staples. This is the\\nlife of someone who’s been blessed with the big terrible thing. And they\\naren’t letting me smoke. It’ll be a good day if I get through it not smoking\\nand nothing crazy happens. When I don’t smoke, I gain weight, too—in fact,\\nrecently I’d gained so much weight that when I looked in a mirror, I thought\\nsomeone was following me.\\nWhen you get sober, you gain weight. When you quit smoking, you gain\\nweight. Those are the rules.\\nAs for me, I would trade places with each and every one of my \\nfriends—\\nPressman, Bierko, any of them—because none of them had the big terrible\\nthing to deal with. None of them had battled their entire lives with a brain that\\nwas built to kill them. I would give it all up to not have that. No one believes\\nthis, but it’s true.\\nMy life is no longer on fire, though. Dare I say it throughout all this\\nturmoil. I have grown up. I am more real, more genuine. I don’t need to leave\\nthe people in a room screaming in laughter. I just need to stand up straight\\nand leave the room.\\nAnd hopefully not walk directly into the closet.\\nIt’s a calmer me now. A more genuine me. A more capable me. Sure,\\nthere is a chance that if I want a good role in a movie, I’d have to write it\\nnow. But I can do that, too. I am enough. I am more than enough. And I don’t\\nneed to put on a show anymore. I have made my mark. Now it’s time to sit\\nback and enjoy it. And find true love. And a real life. Not one that is run on\\nfear.\\nI am me. And that should be enough, it always has been enough. I was the\\none who didn’t get that. And now I do. I’m an actor, I’m a writer. I’m a\\nperson. And a good one at that. I want good things for myself, and others, and\\nI can continue to work for these things. There is a reason I’m still here. And\\nfiguring out why is the task that has been put in front of me.\\nAnd it will be revealed. There is no rush, no desperation. Just the fact that\\nI am here, and I care about people, is the answer. Now when I wake up, I\\nwake up curious, wondering what the world has in store for me, and I for it.\\nAnd that’s enough to go on.\\nI want to keep learning. I want to keep teaching. Those are the grandhopes I have for myself, but in the meantime, I want to laugh and have a\\ngood time with my friends. I want to make love to a woman I am madly in\\nlove with. I want to become a father and make my mother and my father\\nproud.\\nI love art now, too, and have started collecting. I got my Banksy \\npainting\\nat an auction in New York. I bought it via the phone. I’ve never met him, but\\nI want him to know that if there was ever a fire, my Banksy would be the\\nthing I’d save. I wonder if he’d care. (Actually, he’d probably set fire to it\\nhimself.)\\nI have accomplished a lot in my life, but there is still so much left to do,\\nwhich daily excites me. I was a kid from Canada who had all his dreams\\ncome true—they were just the \\nwrong\\n dreams. And instead of giving up, I\\nchanged and found new dreams.\\nI keep finding them all the time. They’re right there in the view, in the\\nValley, on the edgings and flashes that bounce off the ocean when the sun\\nhits … just so.\\nWhen someone does something nice for someone else, I see God. But you\\ncan’t give away something you don’t have. So, I try to improve myself daily.\\nWhen those moments come and I am needed, I’ve worked out my shit, and\\ndo what we are all here for, which is simply to help other people.INTERLUDE\\nThe Smoking Section\\nOne fine day, God and my therapist got together and decided to miraculously\\nremove my desire to take drugs. A desire that has been plaguing me since\\n1996.\\nMy therapist said to me, “The next time you think about OxyContin, I\\nwant you to think about living out the rest of your days with a colostomy\\nbag.”\\nGod didn’t say anything, but then, he doesn’t have to because he’s God.\\nBut he was there.\\nHaving had a colostomy bag for nine long months, my therapist’s words\\nhit hard. And when this man’s words hit hard, the prudent thing to do is to get\\ninto action immediately. What he said caused a very small window to open,\\nand I crawled through it. And on the other side was a life without OxyContin.\\nThe next move up from OxyContin is heroin. A word that has always\\nfrightened me. A fear that has undoubtedly saved my life. My fear, of course,\\nis that I would like that drug so much, I would never stop doing it and it\\nwould kill me. I don’t know how to do it, and I don’t want to learn. Even in\\nmy darkest days that was never an option.\\nSo, since heroin was a no-go and OxyContin had been the only \\ndrug I had\\never wanted to take, it was safe to say that my desire to take drugs had\\nvanished—couldn’t find it if I tried, and I was not trying. I felt lighter on my\\nfeet. I felt a freedom. The monkey was off my back. The part of my brain that\\nwas out to kill me had vanished. Well, not so fast.\\nI had recently had my fourteenth stomach surgery, this one to remove a\\nhernia that was protruding through my abdominal wall. It had been verypainful, and I had been given OxyContin. We addicts are not martyrs—if we\\nare in serious pain, we are allowed to have pain medication, it just has to be\\ndone carefully. This means the bottle of pills is never in my hand, and the\\nmedication is always administered by someone else, and as prescribed. It also\\nmeant I had a brand-new scar on my stomach, this time a six-inch incision.\\nReally, guys? My colon burst, you opened me up to the point where you\\ncould get a bowling ball in there, but now I get the biggest scar?\\nAfter the surgery, the moment I took the drug my pain dissipated, but\\nsomething else happened: I could feel my digestive tract freezing up once\\nagain. PTSD, anyone? And when that happened it was straight to the\\nemergency room, where I knew they would either give me something to help\\nme go to the bathroom or tell me that I needed surgery right away. And any\\ntime I had a surgery there was a chance I would wake up with a colostomy\\nbag. It had happened twice already, it could so easily happen again.\\nYou know what could ensure that I would never wake up from a surgery\\nwith an irreversible colostomy bag? Quitting doing OxyContin. Which I had\\nalready done. I was free. There are no words to describe how humongous this\\nnews was. I have not been interested in taking a drug since. So, I will steal Al\\nMichaels’s immortal words when a bunch of college kids beat the fucking\\nRussians in ice hockey in 1980 in Lake Placid.\\n“Do you believe in miracles? Yes!!!!!!!”\\nI still can’t watch that game without shivers running up my spine. Well,\\nthis was my time, my miracle.\\nI have always believed in the theory that God doesn’t put in front of you\\nthat which you can’t handle. In this case, God gave me three weeks. Three\\nweeks of freedom. And then, he placed a new and gigantic challenge in front\\nof me.\\nI had been ignoring it. Pretending that it wasn’t really happening, or that\\nit would suddenly disappear.\\nAt that time, when I lay down to go to sleep, I started to hear a wheezing.\\nSometimes it was loud enough that I couldn’t sleep, sometimes it was softer\\nand lasted longer. But when I decided to look into it, because God thought I\\nwas ready, I was worried. My hope was that it was bronchitis or something\\nthat could be treated with an antibiotic, but I feared the worst.My pulmonary doctor had a one-week waiting list, so I had seven days of\\nlying down and hearing this awful sound during my most vulnerable and\\nloneliest time of night. That week went by so slowly. Sometimes, I would sit\\nup, and smoke a cigarette, and hope that would make the wheezing disappear.\\nI am no rocket scientist.\\nEventually, the morning of the appointment arrived, and along with the\\never-present Erin, I showed up for a breathing test. I breathed as hard as I\\ncould into a tube for a couple of minutes and was then told to wait in the\\ndoctor’s office for my results. I made Erin wait with me; I was afraid it was\\nterrible news. Remember, folks, we are wanting to hear bronchial infection\\nhere. And because of the miracle three weeks earlier, I had no place to hide if\\nit was bad news.\\nAfter a very long while, the doctor waltzed into his office, took a seat,\\nand announced (rather nonchalantly, I thought, given the stakes) that my\\nyears of smoking had taken a great toll on my lungs and if I didn’t quit\\nsmoking now—today—I was going to die when I was sixty. In other words, it\\ndidn’t fucking matter if I had a bronchial infection.\\n“No, something much much worse,” he said. “But we caught it early\\nenough that if you did quit smoking, you could well live into your eighties.”\\nStunned, frozen in fear, grateful that we had caught it in time—these were\\nthe thoughts that swirled in my head as we left to get in the car. We just sat\\nthere for a while, me wishing the car was a DeLorean so we could go back to\\n1988 and I could never pick up one of these poisonous, life-engulfing things\\nin the first place.\\nI somehow managed to be upbeat.\\n“Well,” I said eventually, “we have a no-brainer on our hands here. I’m\\ngoing to smoke for the rest of the day. And tomorrow morning at seven \\nA.M.\\nI’m going to quit smoking for the rest of my life.”\\nI had quit smoking before, for nine months, but the process then had been\\ndisastrous. Erin—because she remains the single nicest person in the world—\\nsaid she would quit with me.\\nI was initially allowed to vape, but eventually that would have to go, too.\\nAnd 7:00 \\nA.M.\\n the following day came around far too quickly. My home\\nwas cleared of all cigarettes, and I clung to the vape for dear life. Iremembered from previous attempts to quit that days three and four were the\\nworst, but if I could make it to day seven, I would be home free.\\nIt was as awful as you might imagine. I basically stayed in my room and\\nvaped and waited for the horrible feelings to go away. But I was brave. I\\ncould do this.\\nBut day seven came and went, and I still felt terrible. I was craving a\\ncigarette to such a degree that I didn’t think possible. By day nine, I couldn’t\\ntake it anymore—I walked out of my room at home and said, “I want a\\ncigarette.” The nursing staff was there to make sure I didn’t do drugs, not to\\nstop me smoking a cigarette, so they gave me one. When I tell you that I got\\nhigh off it, I mean very high—the drive-home-in-the-red-Mustang-in-Vegas\\nhigh.\\nThe remaining eight cigarettes that I smoked that night did not feel that\\nway. They just made me feel like shit while also scaring the shit out of me.\\n(“Shit” used twice, although bad writing, is intentional.)\\nI was a fifty-two-year-old man, and unless this is the first page you’ve\\nread in this book, you already know that my plan was to have the rest of my\\nlife be both the long, and the good, part. So, I tried! I lay in my bed not\\nsmoking for nine days.\\nI could quit every drug in the history of drugs, but cigarettes were going\\nto be the toughest? Is everybody kidding?\\nIt was decided that going from sixty cigarettes a day to zero had been too\\nmuch for me to take and I would cut my smoking down until a better plan\\ncould be worked out. For the following few days, I managed to drop from\\nsixty to ten. Though this was something, let’s not forget: my life was on the\\nline and I needed that number to go down to zero and fast. Any efforts to\\nbring the number under ten were exercises in futility.\\nEnter Kerry Gaynor, hypnotist extraordinaire. I had tried quitting\\nsmoking with him before, but it hadn’t worked. This time around proved to\\nbe a much different situation. Sitting in front of Kerry Gaynor that day was a\\ndesperate man who wanted to quit. I really wanted to quit—fuck, I needed to.\\nI don’t know real love, I’ve never looked into my children’s baby blues. Plus,\\nemphysema was a horrible way to go, its oxygen tanks and breathing tubes:\\n“Hi, this is Matthew Perry, you’ve of course met my breathing tube.”But could a mind like mine be hypnotized? I had constant racing thoughts\\nand auditory hallucinations.… So, if I can’t control my mind, how is some\\nhypnotist going to do it? I loved smoking—some days it was my only reason\\nfor living—in fact, I would stay up late just so I could keep smoking\\ncigarettes. Plus, it was the last thing I had left. Without it there would be\\nnothing separating me from me. I had quit drinking forever when God visited\\nme in my kitchen. I had recently \\nquit drugs for the rest of my life when a\\ncolostomy bag scared the shit out of me. Did I actually just say that? How\\ncould I possibly do it? What’s the point of doing anything if you can’t\\nsmoke?\\nThings did not start out well. I got to the place, rang the doorbell, a\\nperfectly nice person opened the door, and I said, “Hi, is Kerry here, I’m\\nsupposed to meet with him?”\\nKerry was not there, as it was the wrong house. I wondered how that\\nperson had felt having Chandler Bing ring his doorbell.…\\nFive houses down I saw Kerry standing in front of his house, waiting for\\nmy arrival. I was terrified—my last crutch, not to mention my life, hung in\\nthe balance.\\nKerry’s office wasn’t quite what I was expecting from the highest priced\\nhypnotist in the world—strewn with papers and pictures and antinicotine\\nsigns. We sat down and he started into his “smoking is terrible” thing—yeah\\nyeah, I know that. Let’s get to the good stuff.\\nI explained just how dire it was, and he told me we’d need three meetings\\n—I am a special case, apparently. The chat over, I lay back, and for ten\\nminutes he hypnotized me.\\nI felt nothing, of course.\\nYou are supposed to keep smoking between meetings, which I was\\ngrateful for, but to make things easier on my lungs, and for Kerry, I stuck to\\njust ten. (Anyone can smoke three packs a day, like I did, but you really need\\nonly about ten cigarettes to get the nicotine your body craves. The other fifty\\nis just the habit.)\\nDuring the second session Kerry brought out every scare tactic he could\\nmuster. I was naive to think that the next cigarette wouldn’t kill me. (I\\ndidn’t.) I could have a cigarette right now, have a heart attack, and if no onewas around to call 911, I was a goner. My next cigarette could make my\\nlungs not function permanently, and I would have to live out the rest of my\\ndays carrying oxygen tanks and breathing only through my nose. (I thought,\\nThat’s worse than a colostomy bag,\\n but I \\ndidn’t say it out loud.) Would I\\nrather have a cigarette or breathe the next morning? (I knew the answer to\\nthis one.)\\nBefore he hypnotized me this second time, I tried to explain my crazy\\nracing mind to him.\\n“I’m not sure you’re going to be able to hypnotize me,” I said.\\nKerry just smiled knowingly—he’d probably heard that line a thousand\\ntimes I suppose—and told me once again to lie down.\\nI was on his side. I wanted this to work. But I still wasn’t sure it was\\nworking. I left his office and went back to the ten per day, but something had\\nchanged: each one frightened me more than the last. If nothing else, Kerry\\nhad done a masterly job of instilling terror in each drag. Something really\\nwas different.\\nAnd then there we were, at our final meeting. This was it—after this, I\\nwas supposed to quit smoking forever. I had explained to him that I had had a\\nhorrible time every time I tried to do this—it was harder to quit than drugs.\\nAnd I have done some pretty insane things (see under: head, wall) while\\nquitting smoking. I’m terrified of the withdrawals.\\nKerry listened patiently, then calmly pointed out that he had helped\\nthousands and thousands of people quit smoking, and all his feedback said\\nthe same thing: there is a little discomfort on the first two days, and then\\nnothing. But you can’t touch nicotine—no vapes anymore.\\nBut this had absolutely not been my previous experience, and I told him\\nso.\\n“You’ve never wanted to quit before, and you have never done it the right\\nway, with me,” he said. He was right, I did want to quit. There was no\\ndoubting that.\\nWith that, I lay down once again, and he hypnotized me. But this time it\\nfelt different—I was very relaxed and sleepy. I realized as Kerry talked\\ndirectly to my subconscious that my mind was not racing.\\nThen, it was over.I stood up, asked if I could give him a hug, and he obliged. Then I walked\\nout of his office a nonsmoker. For good—no matter what. Back at home, the\\nplace had been cleared of all nicotine products and vapes (which can kill you\\njust as fast as cigarettes can, according to Kerry).\\nBy now it was about 6:00 \\nP.M\\n., and my job was to make it to 9:30 without\\nhaving a cigarette.\\nBut something had changed—I didn’t want one.\\nDay one was slightly uncomfortable, as was day two. And then the bad\\nfeelings were gone, just as Kerry had told me they would be. I had zero\\nwithdrawal symptoms. Nothing. And I didn’t want to smoke.\\nIt worked. How he managed to remove my withdrawal symptoms and\\nhow that is even possible medically via hypnosis is a mystery to me. But I\\nwasn’t going to ask any more questions.\\nSure, I reached for a cigarette at least fifty times a day, but that was just\\nhabit. I noticed something else, too—the wheezing was gone. Kerry Gaynor\\nhad saved my life. I was a nonsmoker.\\nIt was another miracle. In fact, the miracles were flying around fast—\\nduck or you might get hit with one. I don’t want to do drugs, and I am a\\nnonsmoker.\\nI had been off the smokes for fifteen days. I looked brighter, I felt better, I\\nhad to take fewer breaks during pickleball games. There was life in my eyes.\\nBut then something happened. I took a bite into a piece of toast with\\npeanut butter smeared on it, and all my top teeth fell out. Yes, all of them. A\\nquick pop to the dentist was in short order—I am, after all, an actor, and\\nshould have all my teeth in my mouth, not in a Baggie in the pocket of my\\njeans. But disaster struck and major work was needed. The dentist had to\\nremove every single one of my teeth—including the implants that were nailed\\ninto my jaw—and then replace them all with new ones. I was told this would\\nhurt for one or two days and the pain could be handled with Advil and\\nTylenol. But these were just fucking \\nthrowbacks from the sadistic dentist\\nplayed so well by Steve Martin in \\nLittle Shop of Horrors.\\nHow long did it actually hurt?\\nSeventeen days.\\nCould this pain be blocked with Advil and Tylenol?Absolutely not.\\nHow far into this did I get overwhelmed and smoke a cigarette?\\nThree days.\\nI simply could not handle that degree of pain and not smoke at the same\\ntime. I felt like a miracle had been handed to me, and I gently tossed it back\\nand said “No thanks, not for me.”\\nI would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to the dental\\nsurgeon who was in charge of all of this: “Fuck off, you big piece of nothing\\nfuck. Fuck asshole loser fucking fuck face.”\\nNow I feel better.\\nAfter that, I basically began stalking Kerry Gaynor. I would meet with\\nhim any chance I could, and then buy a pack of cigarettes and have one, and\\nthen wet the rest of the pack under the faucet. I never lied to Kerry—I would\\ntell him what went on, and thank goodness he would not shoot the wounded.\\nI said all the mantras and developed a pretty severe fear of smoking—a little\\nbit of fear with every puff.\\nBut I was still smoking.\\nThe not-wanting-a-cigarette did not return. I was going to have to come\\nout swinging, which consisted of frozen grapes and twenty minutes on the\\ntreadmill every time I wanted a cigarette. I pictured a man who weighed a\\nhundred pounds from all this treadmill walking saying in a very high-pitched\\ntone, “God, I wish I had a cigarette!”\\nVaping was not an option. The patch was not an option. Lying was not an\\noption. (What good would that do?) I would get through four days and I\\nwould smoke and have to start all over again.\\nBut I would not give up—I could not give up. \\nMy life has been so\\ndifficult, I deserve to smoke. I wrote a screenplay, I deserve to smoke.\\n These\\nthoughts had to be dispelled immediately because they gave the addict hope.\\nAnd then I had the wise idea to book Kerry two mornings in a row—\\nsurely, I couldn’t smoke knowing I was going to see him the very next\\nmorning. It was a rough night, but I had had my share of those, and the next\\nday I was able to saunter into his weird-looking office having made it and\\nready to have our brief conversation and get hypnotized again.\\nI could have played his role by now—we could have switched seats. Iwould be the one who would offer him a very weird-looking blue children’s\\nplastic cup of lukewarm water. But this was day two (it’s the little wins). He\\nhypnotized me, scared the shit out of me again, and sent me away with an\\nappointment with him a week hence. Back at home I kept a very busy\\nschedule because I could not let boredom in, it being the devil’s playground\\nand all.\\nWell, boredom, and that girl who broke my heart when I was thirty.\\nI used to take fifty-five Vicodin a day and I quit that, so I was not going\\nto let this disgusting, smelly, absolutely calming and wonderful habit get me\\ndown. Would I rather smoke, or breathe? Breath—what a wonderful thing\\nthat we all take for granted.\\nCigarettes had already made me very sick. Also, they are bad for you. It\\nsounds like I’m joking, but these are the things you have to remember. I had\\nmy comeback as an actor to think of (I had not acted since my accident); I\\nhad a book to write and promote, and I couldn’t very well promote it holding\\na cigarette in my hand. I also could not just eat my way out of this situation.\\n“Quit drinking, doing drugs, smoking cigarettes! Here’s how: just eat six\\nchocolate cakes every night!” This wasn’t exactly the message I wanted to\\nconvey.\\nI had a record I had to break: fifteen days. And with that would \\ncome the\\ncooling comfort of not wanting to smoke. I’ve been there before, and I could\\ndo it again: the complete rebuilding of a man. I didn’t know this man, but he\\nseemed to be a nice guy, and it looked like he had stopped beating the shit out\\nof himself with a baseball bat finally.\\nI was very eager to see who this man was!11\\nBatman\\nI never imagined I’d be fifty-two and single and not playing fun, dumb games\\nwith very short, cute kids running around repeating nonsense words that I had\\ntaught them all just to make my beautiful wife laugh.\\nFor years I thought I wasn’t enough, but I don’t feel that way anymore. I\\nthink I’m just the right amount. But still, each morning, when I wake up,\\nthere are a few brief moments when I am hazy, lost to dreams and sleep, and\\ndon’t exactly know where I am, I remember my stomach and the scar tissue\\nthat comes with it. (I finally have rock-hard abs, but they aren’t from sit-ups.)\\nAnd then I swing my legs off the bed and tiptoe to the bathroom, so that I\\ndon’t wake … um, no one. Yessiree, I am as single as can be. I look in the\\nbathroom mirror, hoping to see something there that would explain\\neverything. I try not to think too hard about the incredible women I had\\npassed over because of a fear it took me too long to understand. I try not to\\ndwell on this too much—if you spend too much time looking in the rearview\\nmirror, you will crash your car. Still, I do find myself longing for a\\ncompanion, a romantic one. I’m not picky—about five \\nfoot two, brunette,\\nsmart as a whip, funny, mostly sane will do. Loves kids. Tolerates hockey.\\nWilling to learn pickleball.\\nThat’s all I ask.\\nA teammate.\\nEventually, if I stare long enough, I watch as my face starts to disappear,\\nand I know it’s time to head out to my patio and my view.\\nOut there, below the bluffs and the freeways and the meditation center\\nwhere I read my list to my sponsor, out there where the California gulls swirland swoop, I watch the ocean ripple, slate gray with edgings of blue. I have\\nalways thought that the ocean mirrors the subconscious mind. There’s beauty\\n—coral reefs, brightly colored fish, spume, and refracted sunlight—but\\nthere’s something darker, sharks and tiger fish and endless deeps just ready to\\nswallow rickety fishing boats.\\nIts size is what most calms me; its size, and its power. Big enough to get\\nlost in forever; strong enough to hold up great oil tankers. We are as naught\\ncompared to its vastness. And have you ever stood on the water’s edge and\\ntried to stop a wave? It goes on, regardless of what we do; regardless of how\\nhard we try, the ocean reminds us that we are powerless in comparison.\\nWatching the ocean, I find myself most days filled with not just longing,\\nbut also peace and gratitude and a deeper understanding of just what I’ve\\nbeen through, and where I am now.\\nFor a start, I’ve surrendered, but to the winning side, not the losing. I’m\\nno longer mired in an impossible battle with drugs and alcohol. I no longer\\nfeel the need to automatically light up a cigarette to go with my morning\\ncoffee. I notice that I feel cleaner. Fresher. My friends and family have all\\nmentioned it—there is a brightness about me that none of them had seen\\nbefore.\\nIn the appendix, “The Spiritual Experience,” at the end of AA’s Big\\nBook, I read this:\\nQuite often friends of the newcomer are aware of the difference long\\nbefore he is himself.\\nThis morning, and every morning out there on the patio, I am as the\\nnewcomer. I am filled with, energized by, the “differences”—no drink, no\\ndrugs, no cigarettes.… As I stand there, coffee in one hand and nothing in the\\nother, and watch the distant waves in the ocean, I realize that I am feeling a\\nwave of my own, inside me.\\nGratitude.\\nAs the light of the day deepened, and the ocean changed from silver to thepalest aqua, the wave of gratitude grew until within the wave I saw faces and\\nevents and little bits of flotsam that had been moments in my eventful life.\\nI was so grateful to be alive, to have a loving family—this was not the\\nleast of it, and perhaps the best thing of all, in fact. There, in the water’s thin\\nspray, I saw my mother’s face, and thought about her ineffable ability to step\\nup in a crisis, to take charge and make things better. (Keith Morrison once\\nsaid to me, “During all the four decades I have been with your mom, her\\nincredible attachment to you has been the central part of her life. She thinks\\nabout you all the time. Way back in 1980, when things got serious between\\nus, she said something I’ve never forgotten: ‘No man will ever come between\\nMatthew and me—he’ll always be the most important person in my life.\\nYou’ll have to accept that.’” And it’s true—there was never a moment I\\ndidn’t feel that love. Even in our darkest moments. If something is really\\nwrong, she is still my first call.) I saw my father’s ridiculously handsome\\nface, too, and it seemed appropriate that I saw him both as my father, and as\\nthe Old Spice sailor guy, though that last image had long faded to a distant\\npoint on the horizon. I think about them withstanding being \\nin the same room\\ntogether when I was really sick, and what kind of love that betrays. They\\ndidn’t belong together. I get that now. So, I’d like back all the coins I’ve\\ndropped into wells, wishing that they were together. They both got lucky and\\nmarried the people they were supposed to be married to.\\nMy sisters’ faces shadow my parents’, as does my brother’s, each of them\\nbeaming at me, not just at a hospital bedside, but also in Canada and Los\\nAngeles as I tried to crack them up with my patter. They never dropped the\\nball once, any of them, never turned their backs on me, ever. Imagine such\\nlove if you can.\\nLess profound, but no less thrilling, images gurgled up from the roiling\\nwaters: the LA Kings winning the Stanley Cup in 2012, me in row seven\\nscreaming at the second line to keep up the pressure on the boards. And my\\nrather selfish thought that God made them wind through the playoffs in a year\\nwhen they only made the playoffs in the last days. I had just ended a very\\nlong relationship, and I’m quite sure the Kings went all the way because God\\nsaid, “Hey, Matty, I know this is going to be a hard time for you, so here’s\\nsomething that will last three months and give you a tremendous amount offun and distraction to make it better.” Boom, it did—after charging through\\nthe playoffs like revenging angels of death, it was the Kings over the Devils\\nin six in the finals, and that last game at the Staples Center, a blowout in a\\nStanley Cup game unlike any in two decades, LA up four–zip just a minute\\ninto the second period. I was at every game, even flying myself and some\\npals to the games on the road, too.\\nAs the ice rink of my sports fandom slips back under the water, more\\nfaces appear: the Murray brothers, my dearest oldest friends, with whom I\\ncreated a funny way of talking that eventually touched the hearts of millions.\\nCraig Bierko, Hank Azaria, David Pressman … how their laughter was once\\nthe only drug I needed. But I would never have met them, or gotten\\nanywhere, perhaps, without Greg Simpson casting me \\nin my very first play.\\nYou never know where one thing will lead.… I guess the lesson is, take every\\nopportunity, because something might come of it.\\nSomething huge came of it for me. I closed my eyes, then, and inhaled\\ndeeply, and as I opened my eyes, I was surrounded by my \\nFriends\\n friends\\n(without whom I would have starred in something called \\nNo Friends\\n):\\nSchwimmer, for making us stick together when he could have gone it alone\\nand profited more than all the rest, and deciding we should be a team and\\ngetting us a million bucks a week. Lisa Kudrow—no woman has ever made\\nme laugh that much. Courteney Cox, for making America think that someone\\nso beautiful would marry a guy like me. Jenny, for letting me look at that face\\nan extra two seconds every single day. Matt LeBlanc, who took the only sort\\nof stock character and turned him into the funniest character on the show.\\nEach of them was still just a phone call away. At the reunion, I was the one\\nwho cried more than anyone because I knew what I’d had, and the gratitude I\\nfelt then matches the gratitude I feel today. Beyond those principles there was\\nall the crew, the producers, the writers, the actors, the audience members, so\\nmany faces churning into one face of joy. Marta Kauffman, David Crane, and\\nKevin Bright, without whom \\nFriends\\n would have been a silent movie.\\n(“Could this \\nbe\\n more of a silent movie?”) The fans, so many fans who stuck\\nwith it and still watch—their faces peer back at me now, mute as God, as\\nthough I’m still on stage 24 in Burbank. Their laughter, which for so long\\ngave me purpose, echoes still up these canyon sides, almost reaching me allthese years later.…\\nI think about all the sponsors, and sober companions, and doctors who\\nhad helped me to not screw up the greatest job in the world.\\nI look out at the water, and I say, very quietly, “Maybe I’m not so bad\\nafter all.” And then I head back in for more coffee.\\nIn the house, I find Erin—she’s always there when I need her. I don’t tell her\\nwhat I’ve been thinking about out there, but I can see in her eyes she has an\\nidea, maybe. She doesn’t say anything because that’s what best friends do.\\nErin, Erin, Erin … She saved my life at the rehab when my insides exploded,\\nand she saves it every day still. Who knows what I’d do without her; I intend\\nto never find out. I can tell she’s itching for a cigarette, but she doesn’t break.\\nFind a friend who’ll quit something with you—you’ll be amazed what that\\ndoes for a friendship.\\nNow, the sun is higher, the perfect Southern California day almost at its\\nprime. Way off in the distance I can see boats, and if I squint, I swear I see\\nsurfers lounging in the calm waters. Still this gratitude swirls about me, even\\nstronger now as more faces appear: characters from the Woody Allen movies\\nI love, the TV show \\nLost,\\n Peter Gabriel, Michael Keaton, John Grisham,\\nSteve Martin, Sting, Dave Letterman for having me on for the first time,\\nBarack Obama, the smartest man I have ever spoken to. On the breeze I hear\\nthe piano version of “New York, New York,” by Ryan Adams, recorded at\\nCarnegie Hall on November 17, 2014. I realize all over again that I’m so\\nlucky to have been in this business, to have had not just access to\\nextraordinary people, but to have also been able to affect people the same\\nway something like “Don’t Give Up” by Peter Gabriel affects me (let’s not\\ndiscuss the video with him hugging Kate Bush; it’s almost too much to bear).\\nWhen I think about all the actors who take chances I get a flash, then, of Earl\\nH.’s face, the good version, not the bad, and quickly it’s replaced by the face\\nof my current sponsor, Clay, who has talked me down so often. I think about\\nall the doctors and nurses at the UCLA Medical Center for saving my life. I\\nam no longer welcome in that hospital for getting caught smoking in there\\none last time. To Kerry Gaynor for making sure there was never going to be aone last time. And behind them all, the specter of Bill Wilson, whose\\nestablishment of AA has saved millions upon millions of lives one day at a\\ntime, and \\nwhose organization still refuses to shoot the wounded and always\\nlet the light in for me.\\nI was grateful for dentists.… No wait—I hate dentists.\\nSomewhere behind me, farther up the hill, I catch the hint of the sound of\\nchildren laughing, my favorite sound of all. I pick the pickleball paddle up off\\nthe patio table and do a few practice swings. Until recently I’d never heard of\\npickleball, never thought I’d be well enough to play any kind of sport again.\\nI’d long since stopped swinging a tennis racket, but this new Matty now\\nactually looks forward to afternoons at the Riviera, hitting the bright yellow\\nplastic pickleball.\\nMy reverie is interrupted by Erin.\\n“Hey, Matty,” she says from the kitchen door, “it’s Doug on the phone.”\\nDoug Chapin has been my manager since 1992, and like many people in the\\nbusiness, he has often waited patiently as I dug myself out of whichever hole\\nI was in. To finally be able to work again? To be able to write? Who knew\\nsuch things were possible.\\nMy eyes filled with tears now, the sea seemed farther away, like a dream.\\nSo, I close my eyes and feel such gratitude for all that I have learned in this\\nlifetime; for the scars on my stomach, which just proved I’d lived a life worth\\nfighting for. I was grateful that I was able to help my fellow man in times of\\nstrife and struggle, and what a gift that was.\\nThe beautiful faces of women flash across my retina, the wonderful\\nwomen who have been in my life, and I am thankful again for them\\nanimating me and pushing me to be the best man I can be. My first girlfriend,\\nGabrielle Bober, was the one who pointed out that something was wrong with\\nme and sent me to rehab for the first time. The beautiful, magical Jamie\\nTarses, for not letting me disappear.\\nTricia Fisher, for starting it all; for Rachel’s face; for the nurse in New\\nYork who was a bright shining light during one of my darkest times. I am\\neven grateful to the woman who dumped me after I’d opened myself up. And\\nI am so grateful for all the wonderful women \\nwhom I had broken up with\\nsimply because I was afraid—I am grateful, and sorry.Oh, and available.\\nI would not bring fear-based mistakes into my next relationship,\\nwhenever that may be.… I know that much.\\nThe sun at its highest, it’s time to head back inside to the shade. I hate\\nleaving that view; I’m not sure anyone could quite ever know what a view\\nlike that means to me, an unaccompanied minor no more when I float above\\nthe world like that, about to be parented once again.\\nLife keeps moving; each day is an opportunity, now, a chance for wonder\\nand hope and work and forward motion. I wonder if the A-list actress who\\nhas expressed strong interest in my new screenplay has said yes yet.…\\nAs I step inside, I pause on the threshold. My life has been a series of\\nthese portals, between Canada and LA, Mom and Dad, \\nL.A.X. 2194\\n and\\nFriends,\\n between sobriety and addiction, despair and gratitude, love and\\nlosing love. But I’m learning patience, slowly acquiring the taste for reality.\\nSitting back down at the kitchen table, I dig into my phone to see who has\\ncalled. Not the A-list actress, but there’s time.\\nThis is how life is now, and it’s good.\\nI look over at Erin, and she smiles at me.\\nBeing in a kitchen always brings to mind God. He showed up to me in a\\nkitchen, of course, and in doing so, saved my life. God is always there for me\\nnow, whenever I clear my channel to feel his awesomeness. It’s hard to\\nbelieve, given everything, that he still shows up for us mortals, but he does,\\nand that’s the point: love always wins.\\nLove and courage, man—the two most important things. I don’t move\\nforward with fear anymore—I move forward with curiosity. I have an\\nincredible support group around me, and they save me every day, because I\\nhave known hell. Hell has definable features, and I want no part of it. But I\\nhave the courage to face it, at least.\\nWho am I going to be? Whoever it is I will take it on as a man who has\\nfinally acquired the taste for life. I fought that taste, man, I fought it hard. But\\nin the end admitting defeat was winning. Addiction, the big terrible thing, is\\nfar too powerful for anyone to defeat alone. But together, one day at a time,\\nwe can beat it down.\\nThe one thing I got right was that I never gave up, I never raised myhands and said, “That’s enough, I can’t take it anymore, you win.” And\\nbecause of that, I stand tall now, ready for whatever comes next.\\nSomeday you, too, might be called upon to do something important, so be\\nready for it.\\nAnd when whatever happens, just think, \\nWhat would Batman do?\\n and do\\nthat.Me at thirty-eight years of ageBaby feeding babyEven then I knew: always lead with a drinkA little boy and his dad.
